It is not uncommon for a medium-sized financial institution to have several hundred trainees.

### Anti Money Laundering Training Hours

The required number of training hours can vary based on the regulatory requirements, the complexity of the financial products offered, and the level of risk associated with the institution. Generally, AML training might involve:
