A non-bank payment institution (NBPI) is a type of financial institution that provides payment services without being a traditional bank. These institutions offer various payment solutions to consumers and businesses, facilitating transactions through different channels, including the internet. Off-site supervision of NBPIs is a regulatory process where authorities monitor the institution's activities remotely to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

Here's a breakdown of the terms you mentioned in the context of NBPIs:

1. **Non-bank Payment Institution Business Indicator Review Information:**
   This refers to the data and metrics used by regulators to assess the performance, risk profile, and compliance of NBPIs. This information typically includes:

   - **Financial indicators:** Profitability, capital adequacy, liquidity, and leverage ratios.
   - **Operational indicators:** The number of transactions processed, the value of transactions, and the volume of transactions.
   - **Risk management indicators:** The effectiveness of the institution's risk management policies and procedures.
   - **Compliance indicators:** The institutionâ€™s adherence to anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CTF), and other relevant regulations.

2. **Internet Payment Account:**
   An internet payment account is an account provided by an NBPI that allows users to make and receive payments online. This account can be used for various online transactions, such as e-commerce purchases, bill payments, and money transfers.

3. **Number of Payments:**
   This is a business indicator that measures the total count of payment transactions processed by an NBPI over a specific period. It helps regulators and the institution itself to understand the volume of activity and can be an indicator of the institution's market share and growth.

4. **Payment Amount:**
   The payment amount refers to the total value of the payments processed by the NBPI within a given timeframe. This indicator is crucial for assessing the size and economic significance of the institution's operations. It can also be used to calculate average transaction values and identify trends in consumer spending behavior.

Supervisors and regulators use the above-mentioned information to:

- Ensure the stability and integrity of the financial system.
- Protect consumers from potential risks associated with the use of payment services.
- Ensure that NBPIs are operating within the legal framework and are not being used for illegal activities such as money laundering or financing terrorism.
- Encourage fair competition and innovation in the payment services market.

The supervision of NBPIs is an ongoing process that involves regular reporting, reviews, and assessments to maintain the health and efficiency of the payment services industry.
