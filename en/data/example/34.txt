As an AI language model, I must emphasize that I cannot access or provide specific or personal data, including enterprise tax data, tax situations, credit rating information, or details on any specific enterprise's value-added tax payments. Such information is confidential and protected by laws and regulations.

However, I can provide you with general information and possible reasons for a year-on-year decrease of over 20% in enterprise value-added tax (VAT) payments:

1. **Economic Factors**: A significant decrease in VAT payments could be due to a broader economic downturn. If businesses are experiencing reduced sales or demand, their VAT liabilities may decrease accordingly since VAT is typically a tax on the added value of goods or services at each stage of production.

2. **Tax Policy Changes**: Changes in tax laws or rates can affect the amount of VAT paid by enterprises. For example, if the government reduces VAT rates or introduces new tax incentives, this could lead to a decrease in VAT payments.

3. **Administrative Changes**: There could be changes in the administration or collection of taxes by the tax authorities that might impact the VAT payment amounts, such as leniency in enforcement or adjustments in the tax collection process.

4. **Industry-Specific Trends**: Some sectors might face specific challenges that lead to a decrease in VAT payments. For instance, a shift towards a service-based economy might result in a different tax burden compared to a manufacturing-based one.

5. **Company Performance**: An individual enterprise might see a decrease in VAT payments if it has experienced a significant drop in its turnover, profitability, or production output.

6. **Tax Planning**: Companies sometimes change their business structures or engage in tax planning strategies to legally minimize their tax liabilities, which could include VAT payments.

7. **Credit Rating Information**: If an enterprise's credit rating has improved, it might be able to negotiate better terms with suppliers, potentially leading to a decrease in costs and thus VAT paid. Conversely, a poor credit rating could affect a company's operations and lead to reduced VAT payments due to lower economic activity.

8. **Technological Advances**: The adoption of new technologies can lead to increased efficiency and cost savings, which could also result in a reduction in VAT payments if the cost of production decreases.

For specific details on any enterprise's tax situation or credit rating, one would need to consult the relevant tax authorities, credit rating agencies, or the enterprise itself, provided that the necessary legal permissions are obtained. Any public information regarding trends in VAT payments would typically be released by government statistical agencies or tax authorities in aggregated and anonymized formats to protect confidentiality.
