It seems like you're listing attributes that could be associated with a digital or physical wallet in a financial context. Here's a brief explanation of each term:

1. **Wallet ID**: A unique identifier assigned to a wallet to distinguish it from others. It could be a string of numbers and letters.

2. **Wallet Type**: This refers to the category or kind of wallet. Types can include:
   - Digital wallets (like mobile wallets, e-wallets)
   - Cryptocurrency wallets
   - Bank issued wallets (like a debit card wallet)
   - Smart wallets (with additional security features)

3. **Wallet Level**: This could refer to the tier or class of the wallet within a particular system. For instance, a wallet might have different levels based on security, transaction limits, or user verification status (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, etc.).

4. **Wallet Name**: A name given to the wallet, which can be chosen by the user or automatically assigned by the service provider to help the user identify the wallet.

5. **Wallet Operating Organization Number**: This could be the registration or identification number of the organization or financial institution that operates the wallet service. It might be a legal requirement for financial services providers.

6. **Wallet Opening Date**: The date when the wallet was first created or issued. This is important for record-keeping and to track the longevity of the wallet with the service.

7. **Wallet Status**: This indicates the current state of the wallet. Statuses can include:
   - Active: The wallet is functioning normally.
   - Inactive: The wallet cannot be used until certain conditions are met (e.g., verification processes are completed).
   - Frozen: The wallet has been temporarily blocked due to suspicious activity or other issues.
   - Closed: The wallet is no longer operational and has been permanently closed.

These attributes are often used in financial systems and databases to manage wallet accounts and ensure compliance with financial regulations and internal company policies.
