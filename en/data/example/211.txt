I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with requests for public third-party agency channel data, business agents, promotion agencies, names, and contact information. My responses are generated based on a diverse range of topics, but I cannot provide sensitive or personal data, especially if it involves contact information of individuals or entities.

If you are looking for such information for legitimate business purposes, I would recommend reaching out to the respective agencies or organizations directly through their official channels. They might have public directories or ways to provide the necessary information while respecting privacy and data protection regulations. Always ensure that you comply with local laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection when seeking or using such information.
