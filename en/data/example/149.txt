The payment settlement business in China is regulated by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank. Financial institutions that wish to engage in payment settlement services must comply with the regulations set by the PBOC.

When it comes to account information and the processing time for account opening applications, the following points may be considered:

1. **Account Information Requirements**: Financial institutions in China require various documents and information to open an account. These typically include:

   - Identity proof (such as ID card for individuals or business registration certificate for legal entities).
   - Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement, etc.).
   - For legal entities, additional documents like articles of association, business license, and authorization documents for the signatories.

   For payment settlement accounts, additional information related to the nature of the business, expected transaction volume, and anti-money laundering compliance may also be necessary.

2. **Processing Time**: The processing time for account opening applications can vary. It generally depends on:

   - The financial institution's internal processes.
   - The completeness and accuracy of the information provided.
   - The time taken for background checks and verification.
   - The regulatory requirements and compliance procedures.

   Typically, for individuals, the process might take a few working days to a week if all documents are in order. For legal entities, especially those involving payment settlement services, the process might take longer, potentially several weeks.

3. **People's Bank of China Role**: The PBOC plays a crucial role in overseeing the account opening process, particularly for financial institutions involved in payment settlement. They may:

   - Set standards for the information required.
   - Monitor compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.
   - Approve applications or provide guidelines to financial institutions for approval.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial institutions in China have to adhere to strict compliance standards. The PBOC has been enhancing its regulatory framework to ensure the integrity of the financial system. As such, the account opening process may involve a thorough review of the applicant's compliance with these standards.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information on the account opening application processing time and requirements, it is best to consult the guidelines provided by the PBOC or the specific financial institution in question. The process may also be influenced by the current regulatory environment and any changes in financial policies.
