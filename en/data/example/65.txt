It seems like you're referring to different concepts that are related to business operations. Let's break down each term:

1. Intermediate Business:
This term is a bit vague and can be interpreted in different ways. In a general sense, an "intermediate business" could refer to a company that operates within the supply chain between raw material suppliers and end-consumer markets. It might involve the transformation of goods (manufacturing), the distribution of products, or the provision of services that facilitate the operations of other businesses. For example, a wholesale distributor could be considered an intermediate business as it buys products from manufacturers and sells them to retailers.

2. Business Type:
A "business type" is a classification that describes the nature of a business and the industry it operates within. Common business types include:
   - Sole Proprietorship: A business owned and operated by one person.
   - Partnership: A business owned by two or more people who share the profits.
   - Corporation: A legal entity that is separate from its owners, with shares of stock that can be publicly traded.
   - Limited Liability Company (LLC): A flexible form of business that provides limited liability to its owners.
   - Nonprofit Organization: A business that operates for a purpose other than making a profit.
   - Cooperative: A business owned and operated by the people who use its services or work there.

3. Handling Fee:
A handling fee is a charge assessed by a business for the manual processing of an order or transaction. This fee can cover various services such as picking, packing, labeling, and processing orders for shipment. Handling fees are common in e-commerce, where companies may charge customers for the additional labor required to prepare their order for delivery.

4. Rate:
In a business context, "rate" typically refers to a price, percentage, or measure of a particular cost or value. It could be:
   - Interest Rate: The percentage charged on a loan or earned on an investment.
   - Exchange Rate: The rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another.
   - Fee Rate: The percentage or flat fee charged for a service, such as a handling fee.
   - Tariff Rate: The tax imposed on imported or exported goods.
   - Discount Rate: The reduction in price from the list price of a product or service.

When discussing these terms together, you might be referring to how an intermediate business sets a handling fee at a particular rate. For example, a distribution company might charge a handling fee that is a percentage of the total order value or a flat rate fee, which is the rate they use to calculate the cost of their service for handling the goods before they are sent to the final customer.
