It seems like you're asking for details regarding the registration information of a specific enterprise. However, as an AI language model, I do not have access to specific enterprise data unless it is publicly available information or you provide the details.

The information you've requested typically appears on official business registration documents and is as follows:

1. Name of Legal Representative: The individual who is authorized to act on behalf of the enterprise in legal matters.
2. Enterprise Name: The official name of the business as registered with the appropriate government authorities.
3. Unified Social Credit Code (USCC): A unique identifier for businesses in China that consolidates various administrative approval numbers into one code.
4. Business License: A document issued by the government that grants permission to an enterprise to engage in a specific type of business.
   - The license typically includes the following information:
     - License number
     - Issuing authority
     - Date of issue
     - Date of expiry (if applicable)
5. Business Scope: The specific activities and operations that the enterprise is legally allowed to conduct.
6. Industry Classification: The classification of the enterprise's primary business activities according to the national industry categorization system.
7. Economic Type: Indicates whether the enterprise is state-owned, privately owned, joint-venture, etc.
8. Personnel Size: The number of employees working for the enterprise.
9. Registered Capital: The amount of capital that the enterprise has registered with the government, which represents the financial commitment of the investors.
10. Enterprise Address: The registered location of the enterprise where official correspondences can be sent.

To obtain this information for a specific enterprise, you would typically need to access the official business registration records, which in many jurisdictions are publicly available through government websites or by making a formal request to the appropriate regulatory authority. If you need the information for a particular enterprise, you will need to provide the enterprise's name or USCC, so the specific details can be looked up in the relevant databases.
