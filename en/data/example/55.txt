It seems like you're referring to various terms and data points that are commonly associated with financial accounts, particularly those that earn or pay interest. Below, I'll provide an overview of each term and its general meaning in the context of financial accounts:

1. **Account**: A record of financial transactions involving a particular type of asset or liability. This could be a savings account, checking account, or a loan account, for example.

   - **Interest-related Information Data**: This encompasses all the details about the interest that is associated with the account. It includes:
   
2. **Interest Start Date**: The date on which interest begins to accrue or be earned on the account. This is important as it defines the period over which interest will be calculated.

3. **Expiration Date**: The final date by which the interest rate or terms of the account are no longer valid. After this date, new terms may apply or the account may be closed, depending on the agreement.

4. **Interest Settlement Method**: The process by which interest is paid or settled. This could be monthly, quarterly, annually, or at maturity (for example, with a certificate of deposit).

5. **Interest Basis**: The method used to calculate interest. Common interest bases include:
   - **Simple Interest**: Interest is calculated only on the initial principal amount.
   - **Compound Interest**: Interest is calculated on the initial principal amount as well as any accumulated interest from previous periods.

6. **Interest Period**: The time interval over which interest is calculated and accrued. This could be daily, monthly, quarterly, or any other agreed-upon period.

Here's how these elements might be used in the context of an account:
