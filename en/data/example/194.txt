In the context of financial regulation and consumer rights protection, these terms are often related to the regulatory framework within which financial institutions operate, particularly in China. Here's a brief explanation of each term:

1. Institutions:
   Financial institutions refer to banks, insurance companies, securities firms, and other organizations that provide financial services. They are subject to oversight to ensure they operate in a safe, sound, and fair manner.

2. Financial Consumer Rights Protection:
   This refers to the laws, rules, and practices designed to safeguard the interests of consumers in their financial transactions. It includes measures to ensure transparency, fair dealing, and access to redress mechanisms in case of disputes.

3. Business Information:
   The data and details regarding the operations, transactions, and financial health of a company. This information is crucial for regulators and stakeholders to assess the institution's performance and compliance with regulations.

4. Institutional Self-Assessment:
   A process where financial institutions evaluate their own compliance with laws, regulations, and internal policies. This is often a requirement by regulators to ensure institutions are aware of and adhering to relevant standards.

5. People's Bank of China (PBOC):
   The central bank of China, which formulates and implements monetary policy, regulates financial institutions, and supervises the financial industry to ensure the stability of the financial system.

6. Evaluation:
   The process of assessing the performance, risk level, or compliance of financial institutions. Evaluations can be conducted by the institution itself (self-evaluation), by external auditors, or by regulatory bodies.

7. On-Site Inspection Content:
   The scope and specifics of what is to be examined during an on-site visit by regulators to a financial institution. This can include reviewing books and records, operational procedures, risk management systems, and compliance with laws and regulations.

8. On-Site Inspection Objects:
   The entities, activities, or aspects of a financial institution that are the focus of an on-site inspection. This could include the institutionâ€™s governance structure, internal controls, financial reporting, customer service practices, and consumer protection measures.

In China, the People's Bank of China, along with other regulatory agencies, conducts on-site inspections to ensure that financial institutions are in compliance with the country's financial laws and regulations, and to protect the rights of consumers. These inspections are a critical component of maintaining financial stability and trust within the financial system.
