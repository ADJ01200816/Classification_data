In the context of the loan business, default refers to a situation where a borrower fails to fulfill their repayment obligations as per the terms of the loan agreement. When discussing defaults, several pieces of relevant data information are important to understand and monitor. Here are some key ones:

1. **Default Type:**
   - **Payment Default:** The borrower fails to make the required loan payments on time.
   - **Technical Default:** The borrower breaches a covenant or condition of the loan agreement, which does not necessarily involve missing a payment but could lead to a payment default if not resolved.
   - **Material Adverse Change:** A significant change in the borrower’s financial condition that could affect their ability to repay the loan.

2. **Default Date:**
   - This is the date on which the default occurs, typically calculated from the due date of the missed payment or the date on which a covenant breach is identified.

3. **Relevant Data Information:**
   - **Borrower Information:** Name, contact details, and financial history of the borrower.
   - **Loan Details:** Principal amount, interest rate, maturity date, repayment schedule, and any collateral securing the loan.
   - **Payment History:** Record of all payments made, including dates and amounts.
   - **Financial Ratios:** Debt-to-income ratio, liquidity ratios, etc., which help assess the borrower's ability to service the debt.
   - **Credit Score:** A measure of the borrower's creditworthiness at the time of the loan.
   - **Economic Indicators:**宏观经济指标 Information about the state of the economy that could impact the borrower's ability to repay.
   - **Industry Performance:** How the industry in which the borrower operates is performing, which can affect their business and ability to repay.

4. **Default Penalty Payment Ratio:**
   - This is a percentage that represents the additional amount the borrower must pay as a penalty for defaulting on their loan. It is usually defined in the loan agreement and can be a flat fee or a percentage of the outstanding balance or missed payment amount.

Monitoring these data points is crucial for lenders to manage risk and take appropriate action in case of default. The actions can include negotiating a repayment plan, enforcing loan collateral, or taking legal action to recover the debt. The penalty payment ratio serves as a deterrent to default and can provide some compensation to the lender for the increased risk and costs associated with handling the default.
