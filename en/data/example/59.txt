You seem to be referring to key terms and data points that are commonly associated with the process of borrowing and lending money, specifically in the context of a loan. Below, I'll explain each term:

1. **Loan Business**: This term likely refers to the institution or entity that provides loans to borrowers. It could be a bank, credit union, financial company, or any other organization that engages in the business of lending money.

   - Example: "ABC Bank is a loan business that offers a variety of financial products."

2. **Loan Date**: This is the date when the loan is actually disbursed or given to the borrower. It marks the start of the loan term and is when the borrower typically receives the funds.

   - Example: "The loan date for my mortgage was January 15th, 2023."

3. **Loan Amount**: This is the total sum of money that the borrower receives from the lender. It is the principal amount that the borrower agrees to repay, usually with interest, over time.

   - Example: "The loan amount for the car loan was $25,000."

4. **Repayment Method**: This is the way in which the borrower repays the loan to the lender. Common repayment methods include monthly installments, lump-sum payments, or other structured repayment schedules.

   - Example: "The repayment method for the personal loan is automatic monthly deductions from my checking account."

5. **Repayment Amount**: This is the specific amount of money that the borrower must pay to the lender in each repayment cycle. This amount can include both principal and interest.

   - Example: "My monthly repayment amount for the student loan is $300."

6. **Repayment Date**: This is the due date by which the borrower must make the payment. It is a contractual obligation and missing it can result in late fees or other penalties.

   - Example: "The repayment date for my loan is the first day of every month."

Understanding these terms is crucial for both the borrower and the lender to ensure clarity and compliance with the terms of the loan agreement.
