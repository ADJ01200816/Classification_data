The credit card business involves financial institutions issuing cards to consumers that allow them to make purchases on credit. Here's an overview of the terms you mentioned:

1. **Card Issuance Date:**
   - This is the date when the credit card is physically or virtually issued by the bank or financial institution to the cardholder. It marks the starting point of when the cardholder can begin using the card, provided it has been activated.

2. **Activation Date:**
   - The activation date is the point in time when the cardholder activates their credit card, making it ready for use. Activation is typically a necessary step to ensure that the person who received the card is the legitimate cardholder. The process may involve calling a designated number, using an app, or visiting the bank's website to confirm the card's receipt and begin using it for transactions.

   - Sometimes, the activation date and the issuance date can be the same day, especially with instant-issue cards or if the financial institution automatically activates the card upon issuance.

3. **Credit Limit:**
   - The credit limit is the maximum amount of money that a cardholder is allowed to borrow using the credit card. This limit is set by the issuer based on the cardholder's creditworthiness, which is determined by various factors like income, credit score, and payment history. The cardholder cannot exceed this limit without facing potential fees or a decline in their transaction.

4. **Withdrawal Limit:**
   - The withdrawal limit refers to the maximum amount of cash that can be withdrawn from an ATM or over the counter using a credit card in a certain period (daily, weekly, or monthly). This limit is typically lower than the overall credit limit and may also incur higher interest rates and fees compared to standard purchases. Cash advances, as they are often called, do not usually have a grace period, meaning interest begins to accrue immediately.

Understanding these terms is important for responsible credit card use. Cardholders should be aware of their credit limits and withdrawal limits to manage their spending and avoid incurring unnecessary fees or damaging their credit score.
