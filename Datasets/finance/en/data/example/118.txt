The treasury business of a commercial bank encompasses a range of activities related to the management of a bank's liquidity, including cash management. This is a critical function that ensures the bank can meet its financial obligations and regulatory requirements while also optimizing the use of its liquid assets.

Here's some information on the key components you mentioned:

1. **Cash Management:**
   - **Objectives:** The primary goal of cash management in a commercial bank is to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity to handle day-to-day operations, ensure the bank can meet deposit withdrawals, and also take advantage of investment opportunities.
   - **Activities:** This involves monitoring and forecasting cash flows, managing the bank's investment portfolio, and ensuring compliance with regulatory reserve requirements.

2. **Commercial Banks:**
   - **Role in Treasury Business:** Commercial banks engage in treasury activities to manage their assets and liabilities. They handle deposits, offer loans, and invest in various financial instruments.
   - **Functions:** They bid on and participate in various money market transactions, such as repurchase agreements (repos), and manage their positions in government securities and other liquid assets.

3. **Bidding Interest Rates:**
   - **Process:** When a commercial bank engages in bidding interest rates, it typically does so in the context of offering loans or bidding for funds in the interbank market or in auctions for government securities.
   - **Determinants:** The interest rates that banks bid can be influenced by various factors, including their own cost of funds, the current and expected monetary policy of the central bank, the creditworthiness of the counterparty, and the supply and demand for liquidity in the market.
   - **Impact:** The interest rates that banks bid can affect their profitability, as well as influence the overall interest rate environment in the economy.

In practice, here's how these elements might come together:

- **Treasury Auctions:** Governments often hold auctions to sell their debt securities. Commercial banks, along with other financial institutions, participate in these auctions by submitting bids with the interest rates they are willing to accept for purchasing these securities. The interest rates they bid are usually based on their assessment of the market conditions, the credit risk of the government securities, and their own liquidity needs.

- **Interbank Market:** In the interbank market, where banks lend and borrow funds from each other, interest rates are often determined through a bidding process. Banks with excess liquidity might bid to lend funds at a certain interest rate, while banks in need of funds might bid to borrow at a given rate. The rates at which transactions are agreed upon can influence the overall level of interest rates in the economy.

In both cases, the information that guides bidding decisions is crucial. Banks must manage their positions prudently to ensure they are competitive in the market while also maintaining a strong and stable financial position.
