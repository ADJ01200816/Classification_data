It seems like you are listing terms related to the process of applying for an administrative matter in a business context. Let me provide a brief explanation for each term:

1. **Administrative Matter Application**: This refers to the formal request submitted by an individual or organization to an administrative body or government agency, seeking approval, permission, or a decision on a particular matter. This could include applications for business licenses, permits, or any other official requests that pertain to compliance with administrative regulations.

2. **Business Information**: This is the data and details about a business that may be required for an administrative matter application. It typically includes but is not limited to:
   - Business name
   - Business address
   - Business type or nature of business
   - Ownership information
   - Contact details
   - Financial information (if necessary)
   - Any other relevant data that helps the administrative body understand the business operations.

3. **Administrative Approval Application Number**: Once an application for an administrative matter is submitted, the relevant agency often assigns a unique number to track the application's progress. This number serves as a reference for both the applicant and the agency, facilitating inquiries and ensuring that the application is processed correctly.

4. **Attachment Material Name**: When submitting an administrative matter application, it is common to provide supporting documentation to verify the information provided in the application. These documents are referred to as "attachment materials." The name of such materials might include:
   - Articles of Incorporation
   - Business License
   - Tax Clearance Certificate
   - Environmental Compliance Certificate
   - Technical Specifications or Plans
   - Financial Statements
   - Any other documents required by the specific administrative process.

When filling out an application, it is important to carefully follow the instructions provided by the administrative body, ensuring that all requested business information is complete and accurate, and that all necessary attachment materials are included to avoid delays in the approval process.
