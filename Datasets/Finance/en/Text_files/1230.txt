The customer marketing department utilizes various data for their processes, which include the outcome data from their marketing activities. This data is structured using rule models to generate marketing lists. These lists are then used to trigger task events within the system. Assessment indicators are set up to measure the performance of these tasks, leading to the creation of marketing contacts. The marketing results are analyzed through marketing evaluations, which in turn provide valuable assessment profit information. The data involved in these processes includes customer-specific details such as monthly salaries, tax payments, and other financial records.
