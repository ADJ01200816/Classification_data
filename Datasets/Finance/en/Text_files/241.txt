John Doe, a 35-year-old software engineer, holds citizenship in the United States. His monthly income amounts to $7,500, and he pays approximately $1,200 in taxes each month. His credit card statement for the last quarter revealed several unusual transactions totaling $3,500, which were flagged by the bank's automated system. These transactions occurred in foreign countries and were not consistent with his travel history. Additionally, his credit score, which was previously at 750, has recently dipped to 680, indicating a potential deterioration in financial health. The bank's monitoring reports have identified him as a high-risk customer due to multiple late payments and an increased debt-to-income ratio. Furthermore, a warning was issued regarding his personal debt (PD) level, which has surpassed the threshold set by the bank's risk management policies. An abnormal event was recorded last month when an attempt was made to withdraw $10,000 from his savings account, which was promptly blocked due to suspicious activity. Continuous monitoring of his financial behavior has been recommended to mitigate potential credit risks.
