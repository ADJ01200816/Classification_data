The agreement, documented under file number X123456, specifies that the contractual relationship between the parties commences on January 1, 2023, and is set to terminate on December 31, 2025. During this tenure, the method for settling interest payments is outlined as monthly compounding, ensuring that accrued interest is added to the principal at the end of each calendar month. The benchmark used for calculating the interest is the one-year LIBOR rate, as published by the Intercontinental Exchange on the first business day of each month, currently standing at 2.5%. The interest period is defined as a quarterly cycle, meaning that the interest is recalculated and applied to the outstanding balance every three months, aligning with the fiscal quarters of the calendar year. This structured approach ensures clarity and consistency in the financial obligations and expectations of both parties involved.
