On January 15, 2023, an internal audit was conducted at the XYZ Precious Metals Repository. The audit revealed that the facility held a total of 1,200 kilograms of gold and 750 kilograms of silver in its vaults. Each bar of gold was meticulously measured, with an average weight of 12.5 kilograms per bar, and the silver bars averaged 25 kilograms each. During the month of December 2022, a physical transfer of 150 kilograms of gold and 100 kilograms of silver was executed from the repository to the central bank. The incoming gold and silver were inspected upon arrival, with the gold bars showing a condition rating of 9.5 out of 10, indicating minimal wear, while the silver bars had a condition rating of 8.7, reflecting slight tarnishing. The pure weight of the transferred gold was verified to be 148.5 kilograms after accounting for impurities, and the pure weight of the transferred silver was 98.2 kilograms. These figures were recorded in the daily log and cross-referenced with the digital inventory management system to ensure accuracy. The discrepancies in weight were attributed to standard impurity levels and were within acceptable industry margins. Each transaction was accompanied by a detailed receipt, including timestamps and the initials of the personnel handling the transfer. The audit report was then filed in the company's secure database for future reference and compliance purposes.
