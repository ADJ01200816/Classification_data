His tax contributions amount to £12,000 annually, as per the HM Revenue & Customs filings. The dataset includes his contact number, +44 7700 900000, used for official communications.

Regarding the compensation records, document #CR2345 outlines the results of a recent compensation claim, detailing that the conclusion was reached on March 15, 2023.
