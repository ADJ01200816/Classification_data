The risk investigation information reveals that John Doe, a 35-year-old software engineer, has a clean medical history and no prior insurance claims. His annual income is $120,000, and he pays $15,000 in annual taxes. The underwriting conclusion indicates that he is a low-risk candidate, eligible for standard coverage terms. The underwriting opinion suggests that his stable employment and financial health justify a favorable assessment. The fees for the policy amount to $3,000 per annum, with a discount of 10% applied due to his excellent credit score. Additionally, a reduction of $500 is granted as part of a promotional offer for new customers. The final premium calculation reflects these adjustments, resulting in an annual payment of $2,450.
