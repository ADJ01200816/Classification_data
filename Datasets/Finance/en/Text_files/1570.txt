The system, which is designed for monitoring and recording, operates within an application that runs on a network. It utilizes computer room facilities, including servers and storage units, to process and store data. The monitoring platform is equipped with log data capabilities, capturing the recording time and date of each event. The recording content encompasses various details, such as alarm types and levels, diagnostic information, and relevant data associated with system operations. For instance, an alarm type could be "temperature rise" with an alarm level of "critical," indicating a potential issue in the computer room environment. Diagnostic information might include details about the affected equipment, such as the server ID and specific component failure. The recorded data is crucial for system administrators to identify and address potential problems promptly.
