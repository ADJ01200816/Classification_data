John Doe, a resident of the United States, applied for an extension on his mortgage payment due to unforeseen medical expenses. His current mortgage balance stands at $300,000, with a monthly payment of $2,000. The financial institution granted him an extension period of three months, during which the interest rate was adjusted to 5.5% from the original 4.75%. As a result, the extension amount added to his principal was $1,650, calculated based on the new interest rate over the extended period. This extension was a one-time occurrence, specifically tailored to address his temporary financial hardship caused by the medical emergency. The detailed breakdown of the extension terms was communicated to him via email on March 15, 2023, and he was required to acknowledge the new terms by signing a digital agreement. The revised payment schedule was then updated in the bank's system, reflecting the adjusted due dates and amounts.
