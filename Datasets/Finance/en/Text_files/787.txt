In the financial report for the fiscal year 2023, the multinational corporation XYZ Inc. disclosed that its internal fund surplus within the European division amounted to €15 million. Concurrently, the Asian division experienced a fund shortage of $8 million, primarily due to unforeseen market fluctuations and delayed project completions. To address these discrepancies, the company established a two-way fund pool, facilitating seamless financial transactions between divisions. The total amount allocated to this two-way fund pool reached $23 million, ensuring liquidity and operational stability across all regions. The North American division contributed $10 million to this pool, while the European division added €7 million, equivalent to approximately $8 million based on the prevailing exchange rates. Detailed quarterly reports indicated that the fund pool's utilization peaked in the third quarter, with $12 million being redistributed to support the Asian division's operational needs. The remaining balance of $11 million was maintained as a reserve to mitigate any future financial shortfalls. The implementation of this fund pool mechanism was in line with the company's strategic objective to enhance global financial resilience and optimize resource allocation.
