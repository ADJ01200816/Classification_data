The internal control system within financial institutions is designed to ensure regulatory compliance. During the medium and long-term audit planning process, the annual audit plan is developed, outlining the specific audit plan, audit evidence, and audit project code. The on-site work dates are scheduled, and working papers are prepared accordingly. Audit reports are generated based on the audit objectives, which encompass the audit scope, audit basis, and audit findings. The audit conclusions drawn from these findings are documented, and subsequent audit recommendations are made to improve internal controls and regulatory adherence.
