The individual, identified by the invalid resident ID card number 110101199001011234, attempted to utilize an online verification service provided by the Ministry of Public Security. Upon entering the verification serial number 202301020304, the system cross-referenced the submitted details with the national database. The verified resident ID card, bearing the number 11010119900101123X, was confirmed as legitimate. The start date of the validity period for this verified ID card was recorded as January 1, 2023. The individual's access to the service was temporarily restricted due to the initial discrepancy, which was later resolved upon successful verification. The entire process was logged and timestamped for audit purposes, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The individual's subsequent interactions with the service were monitored to prevent any potential misuse or fraudulent activities. The verification system's algorithms were updated to better detect similar discrepancies in future transactions, enhancing the overall security framework.
