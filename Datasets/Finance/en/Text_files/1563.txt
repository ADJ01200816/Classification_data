In the context of an information system design scheme, the data set includes various attributes that are integral to the system's functionality. One individual, identified by the identifier "User45678", is recorded as having a gender classification of "Male". This individual's nationality is documented as "Canadian", as indicated by the associated alpha-2 country code "CA". The monthly earnings for this user are specified as $7,200, which is detailed in the financial records section. Correspondingly, the annual tax contribution for this user is listed as $18,000, as per the tax records maintained within the system. For communication purposes, a contact number is recorded as +1 (416) 123-4567, formatted in accordance with the North American Numbering Plan. The source code that handles this data includes modules for data encryption and secure storage, ensuring that sensitive information is protected. The code snippet responsible for user data retrieval is as follows:

```python
def retrieve_user_data(user_id):
    user_info = database.query("SELECT name, gender, nationality, monthly_income, annual_tax, phone FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
    return user_info
```

This function interacts with a relational database to fetch the relevant data fields for a given user identifier, ensuring that the system can accurately process and display the required information while maintaining data integrity and security. The database schema is designed to include tables for users, financial records, and tax records, with appropriate foreign key constraints to maintain relational consistency. Each table is indexed to optimize query performance, particularly for frequently accessed fields such as user ID and phone number. The system also incorporates logging mechanisms to track data access and modifications, thereby providing an audit trail for compliance purposes.
