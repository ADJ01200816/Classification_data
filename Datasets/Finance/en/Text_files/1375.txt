John Doe, a male resident of the United States, has entered into a financial agreement where he serves as the primary assurance provider for a loan. The assurance mechanism employed involves a collateral-based approach, specifically utilizing real estate property as the primary asset. This form of assurance falls under the category of tangible asset-backed security. The total monetary value pledged as collateral amounts to $250,000. This figure represents 50% of the total loan amount, thereby establishing a guarantee ratio of 1:2. The detailed terms of the agreement specify that in the event of default, the lender has the legal right to seize and liquidate the pledged property to recover the outstanding debt. The documentation further outlines that the property in question is a residential dwelling located at 123 Main Street, with an appraised market value of $500,000, as verified by a licensed appraisal firm. The agreement also includes provisions for periodic reassessment of the property value to ensure the adequacy of the collateral coverage throughout the loan tenure. Additionally, John Doe has provided a personal guarantee, which stipulates that his personal assets, excluding the primary residence, may also be considered for recovery purposes if the collateralized property alone does not suffice to cover the outstanding loan balance. This comprehensive guarantee structure aims to mitigate the lender's risk while providing a clear framework for asset liquidation procedures. The contract is legally binding and has been notarized, ensuring its enforceability under relevant state and federal laws.
