John Doe, a 35-year-old software engineer residing in San Francisco, California, has entered into a financial agreement with XYZ Bank. As part of the loan application process, he has provided his social security number (SSN: 123-45-6789) and his monthly income, which totals $8,000. To secure the loan, Doe has opted for a collateral-based guarantee method, offering his residential property located at 123 Main Street, valued at $500,000, as collateral. The guarantee type specified in the agreement is a mortgage, with the guarantee amount set at $200,000. This translates to a guarantee ratio of 40%, calculated by dividing the guarantee amount by the appraised value of the property. Additionally, Doe's employment details, including his employer's name (ABC Tech Solutions) and his position (Senior Software Engineer), have been verified. His credit score, standing at 780, was also taken into consideration during the loan approval process. The loan agreement, dated March 15, 2023, outlines the terms and conditions, including an annual interest rate of 4.5% and a repayment period of 15 years. Doe's contact information, including his phone number (555-123-4567) and email address (johndoe@email.com), has been recorded for communication purposes. The agreement also includes the details of the co-signer, Jane Smith, who has agreed to share the financial responsibility. Smith's SSN (987-65-4321), monthly income of $6,500, and her employment details (employed at DEF Healthcare as a Nurse Practitioner) are documented to support her role in the guarantee. The entire agreement is legally binding and has been notarized by Notary Public Michael Brown on March 17, 2023.
