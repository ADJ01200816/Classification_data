ABC Corporation, registered in the United States, operates as a financial intermediary, facilitating transactions between various entities. The company's primary business model involves processing payments and transfers on behalf of its clients. For each transaction, ABC Corporation charges a handling fee of 2.5%, which is deducted from the total amount being transferred. This fee structure is applied uniformly across all types of transactions, regardless of the volume or frequency. Additionally, the company offers a tiered rate system for its premium clients, where the handling fee is reduced to 1.8% for transactions exceeding $100,000. The standard rate for transactions below this threshold remains at 2.5%. Detailed records of these transactions, including the specific amounts, dates, and corresponding fees, are meticulously maintained in the company's secure database. Each transaction record is associated with a unique identifier to ensure accurate tracking and reporting. The company also adheres to stringent regulatory requirements, ensuring that all fees and rates are transparently communicated to clients prior to any transaction. Monthly reports are generated, summarizing the total volume of transactions processed, the aggregate handling fees collected, and the distribution of transactions across different rate tiers. These reports are reviewed by senior management to assess the financial performance and operational efficiency of the intermediary business.
