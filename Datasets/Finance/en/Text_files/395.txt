John Doe, a policyholder with a national identification number of 123456789, has an active life insurance policy underwritten by Global Assurance Company, policy number GAC123456. On March 15, 2023, at 10:45 AM, a request for contract preservation was initiated through the company's online portal. The request was logged under reference ID PRES12345. The preservation involved freezing the current terms of the policy, which includes a coverage amount of $500,000, a monthly premium of $150, and a maturity date set for December 31, 2030. The policyholder's contact information, including a phone number +1 (555) 123-4567 and email address johndoe@email.com, was verified for notification purposes.

Subsequently, on April 2, 2023, at 2:20 PM, a contract change request was submitted, referenced as CHG789012. The change involved altering the beneficiary details from Jane Doe, relationship: spouse, to Emily Smith, relationship: daughter. The reasons for the change were documented as "change in family circumstances due to divorce." The content of the changes specified the new beneficiary's contact information: phone number +1 (555) 987-6543 and email address emilysmith@email.com. The impact of this change was assessed to ensure continuity of benefits and compliance with legal requirements, ensuring no lapse in coverage during the transition.

A preservation correction item was identified on April 5, 2023, at 11:10 AM, under correction ID CORR345678. The correction addressed an administrative error in the initial preservation request, where the policyholder's address was incorrectly recorded as 123 False Street instead of the correct 123 True Avenue. The correction was processed to update the policy records accurately.

The effective time for the contract changes was set for May 1, 2023, at 12:01 AM, ensuring all modifications were legally binding and reflected in the policyholder's records. All changes and corrections were communicated to the policyholder via registered mail and email, with confirmation of receipt logged on April 10, 2023, at 3:15 PM. The entire process was documented in the policyholder's file, maintained securely in compliance with data protection regulations.
