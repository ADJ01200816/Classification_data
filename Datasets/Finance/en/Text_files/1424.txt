The financial asset management company identified non-performing assets that were subject to acquisition and disposal processes. A debt transfer agreement was put in place, with the benchmark date set for the assessment of the assets. The delivery date for the assets was scheduled for a specific future date, while the payment date was determined to be 30 days after the delivery date. The asset transferor was responsible for providing an asset delivery list, which included detailed information about the assets being transferred. Warrant information was disclosed, and any defects were documented in a defect disclosure document. Transition period arrangements were made to ensure a smooth transfer, with an exemption clause included to cover any unforeseen issues. The transfer subject matter contract outlined the terms and conditions of the asset transfer. Interest rate information was provided, and the debtor was informed about the extension information, which included the possibility of extending the payment period if necessary.
