John Doe, a 35-year-old software engineer residing in New York, USA, holds a life insurance policy with ABC Insurance Company. The policy, numbered LIC123456, was originally issued on March 1, 2020, with an annual premium of $3,000. On July 15, 2022, John submitted a request to modify his policy, specifically to increase the coverage amount from $500,000 to $750,000. This request was logged in the company's system as Change Request CR2022071501. The reason for the change, as documented, was due to a recent increase in his household expenses following the birth of his second child. The content of the change included amending Section 3.2 of the policy document, which outlines the coverage limits. The impact of this change resulted in an increase in the annual premium to $4,500, effective from the next billing cycle starting August 1, 2022. The preservation of this change was confirmed on July 20, 2022, by the policy administrator, Jane Smith, who also ensured that all relevant documents were updated and stored in the secure electronic document management system. Additionally, a preservation correction item was noted on July 25, 2022, to rectify an initial error in the premium calculation, which was adjusted to reflect the correct amount of $4,500 instead of the initially误计算的 $4,200. This correction was authorized by the senior underwriter, Michael Brown, and the updated details were communicated to John via email on the same day.
