On March 15, 2023, a financial asset management company headquartered in New York executed an acquisition and disposal agreement for non-performing assets. The asset transferor, identified as XYZ Corporation, agreed to transfer a portfolio of distressed loans to the asset buyer, ABC Holdings, for a sum of $15 million. The debt transfer agreement specified that the benchmark date for assessing the quality of these assets was January 1, 2023. The delivery date for the asset transfer was set for April 30, 2023, with the payment date scheduled for May 15, 2023. 

The asset delivery list included detailed warrant information, outlining the collateral securing each loan. Additionally, the defect disclosure section of the agreement highlighted known issues with certain assets, including incomplete documentation and outstanding legal disputes. The transition period arrangement stipulated a 90-day period during which XYZ Corporation would assist ABC Holdings in managing the transferred assets. 

An exemption clause was incorporated to protect both parties from unforeseen liabilities arising from pre-existing conditions of the assets. The transfer subject matter contract included comprehensive interest rate information, specifying variable rates ranging from 3% to 5% annually. The debtor details were meticulously documented, with individual names, contact information, and loan balances exceeding $50,000 in several cases. Extension information was also provided, allowing for potential renegotiation of loan terms under specific conditions agreed upon by both parties.
