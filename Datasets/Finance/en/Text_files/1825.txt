Bank A, operating under the jurisdiction of the Financial Regulatory Authority, has established a comprehensive framework for organizing its diverse range of offerings. Within this framework, the Retail Banking sector is delineated into several distinct units, each focusing on a particular clientele segment. For instance, the Personal Banking unit caters to individual customers, offering services such as savings accounts, which are categorized under the code 0101, and labeled as "Basic Savings Accounts" at the primary classification level. Meanwhile, the Wealth Management unit provides investment opportunities, with products like mutual funds classified under code 0202 and termed "Equity Mutual Funds" at the secondary level.

In the Corporate Banking division, services are tailored to meet the needs of businesses, with loan products such as "Commercial Loans" falling under code 0301 at the tertiary classification level. The Treasury department, on the other hand, deals with financial markets, offering products like "Foreign Exchange Trading," classified under code 0402 at the quaternary level.

Each product is meticulously assigned a unique classification code and name, ensuring precise identification and categorization. For example, within the Investment Banking sector, the "Initial Public Offering" service is designated with the code 0503 and classified under the "Capital Markets" category at the quinary level. This structured approach allows for efficient management and analysis of the bank's extensive product portfolio, aligning with industry-wide classification standards and facilitating seamless integration with regulatory reporting requirements.
