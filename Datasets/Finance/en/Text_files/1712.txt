The policy, under the reference number INS-987654, underwent a recent update on March 15, 2023. The initial terms included a coverage limit of $500,000 for property damage and a monthly premium of $150. The recent modification involved an adjustment to the coverage limit, which was increased to $750,000. This alteration was necessitated by the policyholder's recent acquisition of additional assets valued at $250,000.

The reasons for the change were documented in a memo dated March 10, 2023, citing the need for enhanced protection against potential liabilities. The content of the changes was meticulously outlined in an amendment document, specifying the new coverage limits and the corresponding increase in the monthly premium to $200. The impact of these changes was assessed in an internal report, indicating a 25% increase in coverage with a 33% increase in premium costs. The effective time of the updated terms was set for April 1, 2023, ensuring a seamless transition without any lapse in coverage. All relevant documents, including the original policy, the amendment form, and the supporting asset valuation reports, were preserved in the electronic records system under secure protocols to maintain confidentiality and compliance with regulatory standards.
