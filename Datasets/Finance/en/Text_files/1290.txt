The accounting records of a financial institution, adhering to established accounting standards, involve the recognition and measurement of various financial data. For instance, the institution maintains detailed accounting records that encompass financial assets, which may include cash, investments, and receivables. In addition, other current assets such as inventory and prepayments are meticulously documented. Long-term investments, fixed assets like property, plant, and equipment, as well as intangible assets like patents and trademarks, are also accounted for in the records. Deferred assets, representing future economic benefits, are recognized and measured in accordance with accounting principles.

Similarly, the institution's accounting records categorize current liabilities, such as accounts payable and short-term loans, and non-current liabilities, which include long-term debt and deferred tax liabilities. The recognition and measurement of owner's equity is a critical aspect of these records, reflecting the contributions made by the owners and the net income retained within the business.

Specific financial data within these records may include, for example, the monthly salary of an employee, which is a current liability for the institution. This salary, which may be reported as a financial obligation in the accounting statements, is subject to taxation, with the tax amount recorded as a separate liability. The telephone number of the employee, while not directly reflected in the accounting records, may be used for communication purposes and is therefore a piece of related data that could be associated with the employee's record.
