The individual identified by the invalid resident ID card number 110105198001011234 attempted to access an online verification service provided by the Ministry of Public Security. The verification serial number assigned to this transaction was 202309150001. Upon submission, the system cross-referenced the provided details with the national database and confirmed the existence of a verified resident ID card with the same number. The start date of the validity period for this verified resident ID card was recorded as January 1, 2015. The discrepancy between the invalid entry and the verified record prompted a security alert, triggering further manual review by the service administrators. The individual's attempt to verify identity was temporarily suspended pending additional verification steps to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The timestamp for the initial verification attempt was logged at 14:35:22 on September 15, 2023. The online verification service maintains a log of all transactions, including both successful and failed attempts, to monitor and prevent fraudulent activities. The individual was advised to contact the local public security bureau to resolve the issue with the invalid resident ID card. The bureau's contact information was provided through an automated email notification sent to the email address associated with the verification attempt, email@example.com. The entire process was documented in the system's audit trail for future reference and compliance audits.
