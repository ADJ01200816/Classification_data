In the comprehensive asset management report, the detailed classification of items includes various categories such as hardware, software, and network devices. Each item is meticulously recorded with its corresponding monetary worth, for instance, a server valued at $25,000 and a software license priced at $5,000. The depreciation rates are outlined, indicating an annual depreciation of 10% for the server and 20% for the software license. The lifecycle stages are documented, showing that the server is in its third year of a projected five-year lifespan, while the software license is in its second year of a three-year term. The interconnections between these assets are depicted through a topology diagram, illustrating that the server is linked to multiple workstations and the software is installed across various departments. Additionally, the security classifications are provided, with the server designated as a Tier 2 asset due to its moderate sensitivity and the software classified as Tier 1 due to its critical role in data processing. Each asset's specific attributes and their relationships within the organizational infrastructure are systematically recorded to ensure accurate tracking and management.
