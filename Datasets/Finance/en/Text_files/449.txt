John Doe, a resident of 123 Main Street, New York, NY 10001, operates a small-scale payment settlement business registered under the fictitious name "QuickPay Solutions." His business primarily handles electronic transactions for local merchants. As of the fiscal year 2022, Doe maintains a deposit account at First National Bank, account number 987654321, specifically designated for fiscal deposits. The balance in this account as of December 31, 2022, was $150,000. Detailed transaction records indicate that Doe deposited a total of $250,000 in fiscal deposits over the course of the year. However, there were instances of delayed payments, with a total of 15 days where payments were not settled within the agreed 3-day timeframe. These delays were primarily due to processing errors and were documented in the monthly statements issued by the bank. Each delayed payment incurred a penalty fee of $50, as per the terms outlined in the service agreement between Doe and the merchants. The longest delay recorded was 5 days, specifically for a transaction dated November 15, 2022, involving a deposit of $30,000. All fiscal deposits and related penalties were meticulously recorded in Doe's financial ledger, which is reviewed annually by an independent auditor.
