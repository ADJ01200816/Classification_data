On March 15, 2023, at 09:45 AM GMT, a financial institution headquartered in New York transmitted an email to its regional office in London. The email was sent from the account of John Doe, an employee with the designation of Senior Financial Analyst, using the company's secure email delivery system, which employs end-to-end encryption. The email was received by Jane Smith, a Compliance Officer, at 10:02 AM GMT. The subject line of the email read "Quarterly Financial Report - Confidential." The content of the email detailed the financial performance metrics for Q1 2023, including revenue figures, expense breakdowns, and profit margins. Attached to the email were three files: a PDF document titled "Q1_2023_Financial_Report.pdf" (size: 2.5 MB), an Excel spreadsheet named "Expense_Detail_Q1_2023.xlsx" (size: 1.8 MB), and a compressed ZIP file labeled "Supporting_Documents_Q1_2023.zip" (size: 4.2 MB). Additionally, the email included two embedded images: a bar chart illustrating revenue trends and a pie chart depicting expense distribution, both generated from the internal financial analytics software used by the institution. The email also contained a footer noting the confidentiality of the information and advising recipients to handle the data with appropriate security measures.
