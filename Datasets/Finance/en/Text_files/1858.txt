In the process of pre-loan risk investigation, the financial asset management company employed statistical methods such as regression analysis and predictive modeling. Utilizing tools like Python's pandas library and SQL databases, they gathered relevant data including borrower's monthly income of $7,500, tax payments of $1,200, and a debt-to-income ratio of 35%. Analytical models were constructed to assess the likelihood of default, incorporating variables such as employment history and credit score of 720. During loan classification, the data was segmented into high, medium, and low-risk categories based on these parameters. Credit reports from agencies like Experian and TransUnion provided comprehensive financial histories, including past defaults and late payments. For project initiation, due diligence was conducted using a checklist that included verifying income statements and bank records. Program information was detailed in a prospectus outlining terms, interest rates, and repayment schedules. This meticulous approach ensured that all aspects of the borrower's financial profile were scrutinized, facilitating informed decision-making in the lending process.
