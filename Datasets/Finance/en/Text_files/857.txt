The IT infrastructure of a financial institution comprises a sophisticated system interconnected through a robust network. The core application, responsible for transaction processing, operates on servers housed within a secure computer room. These facilities are equipped with advanced cooling systems and redundant power supplies to ensure uninterrupted operation. A centralized monitoring platform continuously oversees the network and system performance, generating detailed log data. Each entry in the log includes specific recording times, such as 14:32:56 on October 3, 2023, and the corresponding recording date. The content of these logs varies, capturing details like user authentication attempts, data transfer rates, and system resource utilization. In the event of anomalies, the platform triggers alarms classified by type—such as unauthorized access or hardware failure—and severity levels ranging from low to critical. Accompanying each alarm is diagnostic information that aids in pinpointing the root cause, whether it be a faulty network switch or a corrupted data file. This comprehensive data set is essential for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the institution's IT operations.
