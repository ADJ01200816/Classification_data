In the context of financial institutions, an individual has been identified as a subject of interest due to the submission of a large and suspicious transaction report. The subject has been assessed and assigned a customer risk level based on regulatory standardization data. This assessment is further refined by analyzing list level business data and subject level financial data, which includes details on the individual's financial activities. The individual's information is processed in compliance with the "three meetings and one layer" principle, ensuring that legal person information and institutional information are thoroughly reviewed. The analysis of deposit and loan details reveals that the individual has a monthly income of a certain amount, which corresponds to a specific tax payment.
