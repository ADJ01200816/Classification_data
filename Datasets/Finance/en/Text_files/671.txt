The bank's clientele comprises a diverse range of individuals and corporations, including John Doe, a male resident of the United States, and XYZ Corp, a multinational corporation headquartered in Germany.

Options trading is another key area, with ABC Bank offering both call and put options. A recent transaction involved the sale of 100 call options for StockXYZ at a strike price of $50, expiring in two months, generating a premium of $2 per option.

These activities are governed by stringent risk management protocols, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and minimizing potential financial losses.
