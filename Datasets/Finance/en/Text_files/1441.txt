On March 15, 2023, an internal audit was conducted at the XYZ Precious Metals Repository. The audit revealed that the facility held a total of 1,200 kilograms of gold and 750 kilograms of silver in its secure vaults. Each bar of gold was meticulously measured, with an average weight of 12.5 kilograms, and the silver bars averaged 25 kilograms each. The physical transfer of these metals occurred on February 28, 2023, when 300 kilograms of gold and 150 kilograms of silver were moved from the main vault to a secondary storage unit located on the premises. The condition of the incoming gold and silver was documented as follows: 95% of the gold bars were classified as "mint condition," while the remaining 5% exhibited minor surface scratches. For the silver, 90% was in "excellent" condition, with 10% showing slight tarnishing. The pure weight of the transferred gold was verified to be 295 kilograms after accounting for a 1% impurity margin, and the pure weight of the transferred silver was 147.5 kilograms, considering a 2% impurity margin. Detailed records of these measurements and conditions were logged in the repository's inventory management system under transaction IDs G-022823 and S-022823, respectively.
