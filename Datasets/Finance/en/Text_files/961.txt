The agreement specifies that the commencement of the term is on January 15, 2023, and it is set to conclude on January 15, 2028. The method for settling interest payments is outlined as quarterly, with distributions occurring on the last business day of March, June, September, and December each year. The benchmark utilized for calculating the interest is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), specifically the one-month LIBOR rate as published on the first business day of each month. The period over which interest is calculated spans from the first day of each calendar month to the last day of the same month, ensuring a consistent and transparent approach to interest accrual and disbursement.
