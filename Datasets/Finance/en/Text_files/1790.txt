In the comprehensive dataset compiled for urban development analysis, the property valuation metric is recorded on a quarterly basis. Each entry meticulously details the fluctuations in housing prices across various districts. For instance, the downtown area's average property value was documented at $450,000 in Q1, experiencing a 5% increase to $472,500 by Q2. Suburban regions showed a more modest rise, with initial values at $320,000, escalating to $331,200 over the same period. These figures are complemented by transaction volumes, which are also tracked quarterly. The downtown area witnessed 150 transactions in Q1, rising to 165 in Q2, while suburban areas recorded 120 transactions in Q1 and 130 in Q2. The dataset further breaks down these indicators by property type, with condominiums in the downtown area averaging $350,000 in Q1 and $367,500 in Q2, and single-family homes in suburban areas starting at $280,000 and reaching $290,400 by Q2.
