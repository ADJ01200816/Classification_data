On the 15th of each month, the payment settlement business, operated by a Shanghai-based entity, processes transactions involving various financial institutions. One such institution, headquartered in Beijing, records an average monthly RMB deposit reserve of 1.2 billion yuan. The deposit date for these reserves is consistently set on the last business day of each month. In accordance with the regulations set forth by the People's Bank of China, the statutory deposit reserve ratio stands at 12.5%. This ratio is meticulously applied to ensure compliance and financial stability across all transactions and reserves managed by the institution. Each transaction is logged with a unique identifier, and the data is stored in a secure, encrypted database accessible only to authorized personnel. The system also generates detailed reports that outline the flow of funds, including the specific amounts reserved and the dates on which these reserves are deposited. These reports are reviewed quarterly by internal auditors to ensure accuracy and adherence to regulatory requirements. The payment settlement business maintains a robust infrastructure to handle the high volume of transactions, employing advanced algorithms to optimize fund allocation and minimize processing times. The financial institutions involved are required to submit monthly statements that detail their deposit activities, which are then cross-verified against the central database to ensure consistency and transparency.
