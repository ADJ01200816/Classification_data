In the course of the implementation of informationization projects, the company has established an information system for personnel management. The system contains data on employees, including specific information such as monthly salaries, tax payments, and contact details. For instance, an employee's monthly salary is recorded as 50,000 yuan, with a corresponding tax payment of 8,000 yuan. This data is crucial for the company's planning documents, ensuring accurate financial records and compliance with tax regulations. Contact information, such as phone numbers, is also stored within the system to facilitate communication and record-keeping purposes.
