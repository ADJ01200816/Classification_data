The agreement specifies that the commencement of the contractual period is set for January 15, 2023, marking the initial date from which all stipulated terms and conditions become operational. The termination of this agreement is scheduled for December 31, 2027, indicating the final date by which all obligations must be fulfilled, and the contract ceases to be effective. The method for settling interest payments is outlined as quarterly compounding, wherein interest accrued is added to the principal amount at the end of each three-month period, thereby influencing subsequent interest calculations. The benchmark utilized for determining the interest rate is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), specifically the one-month LIBOR, which serves as the reference point for adjusting the applicable interest rate. The interest period is defined as a monthly interval, meaning that interest is calculated and potentially compounded on a monthly basis, aligning with the chosen interest calculation benchmark. Each of these elements is meticulously detailed within the agreement to ensure clarity and precision in the financial arrangements between the involved parties.
