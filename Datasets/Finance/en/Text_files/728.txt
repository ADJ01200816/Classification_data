On January 15, 2023, an internal audit was conducted at the XYZ Precious Metals Storage Facility. The audit revealed that the facility held a total of 1,200 kilograms of gold and 750 kilograms of silver. Each bar of gold was meticulously measured, with an average weight of 12.5 kilograms per bar, while the silver bars averaged 25 kilograms each. The physical transfer of these metals occurred on January 10, 2023, where 300 kilograms of gold and 150 kilograms of silver were moved from the main vault to a secondary secure location within the facility. The condition of the incoming gold and silver was documented as follows: 98% of the gold bars were classified as "mint condition," with the remaining 2% showing minor surface scratches. For silver, 95% were in "mint condition," and 5% exhibited slight tarnishing. The pure weight of the transferred gold was verified at 295 kilograms after accounting for a 1.67% impurity rate, while the pure weight of the transferred silver was 145 kilograms, considering a 3.33% impurity rate. Detailed records of these measurements and conditions were logged in the facility's inventory management system under transaction IDs G12345 and S67890.
