The IT infrastructure of a financial institution comprises a complex system interconnected through various applications. The network infrastructure spans multiple geographic locations, with the primary data center located in New York and secondary backup facilities in Dallas and San Francisco. Each computer room is equipped with advanced facilities, including redundant power supplies, HVAC systems, and fire suppression mechanisms. The monitoring platform continuously tracks the performance and health of these systems, generating log data every 5 minutes. Each log entry includes a precise recording time, such as 14:35:22, and a recording date, for instance, October 3, 2023. The recording content details specific events, such as "CPU utilization exceeded 85% on server ID 12345." In the event of an anomaly, the system triggers an alarm, which is categorized by alarm type, such as "Network Latency" or "Hardware Failure," and alarm level, ranging from Level 1 (critical) to Level 4 (minor). Diagnostic information accompanying each alarm provides insights into the root cause, such as "Memory leak detected in application module X." This data is stored in a centralized database for further analysis and compliance purposes.
