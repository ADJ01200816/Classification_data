The gender attribute, denoted as "GENDER", contains values such as "M" for male and "F" for female.

The dataset is structured in a relational database format, with each attribute clearly defined and illustrated through sample entries. The "EMP_NAME" field ensures no special characters are included, adhering to a standard naming convention.

The "MONTHLY_INCOME" and "MONTHLY_TAX" fields are both numeric, allowing for precise financial calculations. The "PHONE" field follows a standardized format to ensure valid contact information. Each entry in the dataset is meticulously verified to maintain accuracy and integrity across all fields.
