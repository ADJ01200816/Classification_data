In the financial records of ABC Corporation, the detailed ledger reveals that the entity holds a substantial reserve of precious metals, specifically identified as 150 kilograms of gold and 85 kilograms of silver. These reserves are meticulously documented and stored in a high-security vault located in the downtown district. The allocation of these precious metals is primarily designated for investment purposes, with 60% of the gold allocated to long-term investment portfolios and the remaining 40% reserved for short-term liquidity needs. Similarly, 70% of the silver is allocated to hedge against market volatility, while the remaining 30% is set aside for potential industrial use.

The corporation's financial statements also indicate a significant amount of currency held in RMB. As of the last fiscal quarter, the inventory amount of RMB stands at 5 million yuan. This sum is distributed across various accounts, with 2 million yuan held in a corporate savings account at the XYZ Bank, 1.5 million yuan in a current account at the PQR Bank, and the remaining 1.5 million yuan invested in short-term money market funds. The allocation of these funds is strategically planned to ensure optimal liquidity and return on investment, with regular reviews and adjustments made based on market conditions and the corporation's financial needs. The detailed breakdown of these allocations is recorded in the monthly financial reports, which are accessible only to authorized personnel within the finance department.
