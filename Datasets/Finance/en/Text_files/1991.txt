The financial institution, identified as "commercial banks," has a customer base that includes individuals with varying levels of debt repayment ability. Within this group, a certain percentage of customers utilize financial services such as acceptance bills and standby letters of credit. These customers engage in various guarantee businesses, which are facilitated by the commercial banks. Additionally, financial asset management companies play a role in managing the assets of these customers, often through maintenance agreements that outline the terms and conditions of asset management services provided. The income level of these customers ranges from a minimum monthly salary of 50000 yuan to potentially higher earnings, with corresponding variations in their tax liabilities, which can range from 8000 yuan to more significant amounts. The contact information for these customers is recorded in the bank's database, which includes details such as phone numbers for communication purposes.
