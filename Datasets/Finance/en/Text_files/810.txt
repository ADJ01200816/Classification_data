The Bank of China, as a prominent financial entity, operates across various departments such as Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, and Investment Banking. Within these departments, distinct business lines are established to cater to different market needs. For instance, the Retail Banking sector encompasses personal loans, savings accounts, and credit cards, each meticulously organized under specific product classification standards. Personal loans are further divided into secured and unsecured categories, denoted by classification codes 0101 and 0102 respectively. These codes correspond to product classification names like "Home Loan" and "Personal Overdraft," which are positioned at different product classification levels, namely Level 1 and Level 2.

In the Corporate Banking department, business lines include trade finance, project finance, and treasury services. Trade finance products, such as letters of credit and export credit, are classified under codes 0201 and 0202, aligning with product classification names "LC Facility" and "Export Financing." These classifications are integral for business perspectives, enabling the bank to tailor services to specific corporate needs. Treasury services, on the other hand, are divided into money market operations and foreign exchange dealings, represented by codes 0301 and 0302, and classified under names like "Short-term Deposits" and "FX Trading."

The Investment Banking division focuses on capital market activities, including equity underwriting and debt issuance. Equity underwriting products are categorized under code 0401, corresponding to "IPO Services," while debt issuance falls under code 0402, named "Bond Issuance." These classifications aid in streamlining operations and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

Each financial institution product is meticulously documented and classified to facilitate efficient management and reporting. For example, the "Wealth Management" product in the Retail Banking sector is classified under code 0103, positioned at Level 1, and further subdivided into "Fixed Income Funds" (code 010301) and "Equity Funds" (code 010302) at Level 2. This hierarchical structure ensures clarity and precision in product offerings, aligning with both internal management needs and external regulatory requirements.

In summary, the intricate classification system within the Bank of China encompasses various departments, business lines, and specific product classifications, each denoted by unique codes and names, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the bank's diverse product portfolio from multiple business perspectives.
