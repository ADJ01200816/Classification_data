In the context of customer service management, an individual identified by the unique identifier 4532-AZL has submitted a request for the preservation of their insurance contract, specifically policy number IN123456. The preservation process was initiated on March 15, 2023, following a detailed review of the customer's account history. The customer had previously undergone two contract modifications, the first on June 10, 2022, and the second on December 5, 2022. The initial modification included the addition of a critical illness rider, while the subsequent change involved an adjustment to the policy's beneficiaries.

The preservation correction items included verifying the accuracy of personal details such as the customer's date of birth, January 8, 1985, and their residential address, 789 Maple Street, Springfield, IL 62704. The reasons for these changes were documented as a need to align the policy with the customer's updated health status and family circumstances. The content of the changes specified the inclusion of the critical illness rider with a coverage limit of $200,000 and the reassignment of beneficiary rights to the customer's spouse, identified as Jane Doe.

The impact of these changes resulted in an increase in the monthly premium from $150 to $180, reflecting the enhanced coverage. The effective time of the initial change was June 15, 2022, and for the second change, it was December 15, 2022. All modifications were communicated to the customer via email on the respective dates, with confirmation of receipt and understanding provided by the customer through an electronic signature on the revised policy documents. The preservation process ensured that all changes were accurately reflected in the system, maintaining the integrity and enforceability of the insurance contract.
