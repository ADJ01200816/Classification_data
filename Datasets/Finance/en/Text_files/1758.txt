In the context of the credit management business, the financial credit information basic database serves as a pivotal repository. This database encompasses data from various financial institutions, including 35 urban commercial banks and 5 state-owned commercial banks. Each entry in the database meticulously records detailed financial transactions and credit histories of individual clients. For instance, an entry might indicate that a client, identified by the unique identifier 123456789, has a credit line of 200,000 yuan with Bank A, an urban commercial bank, and a mortgage loan of 1.5 million yuan with Bank B, a state-owned commercial bank. The database also logs the client's monthly repayment amounts, such as 10,000 yuan for the credit line and 20,000 yuan for the mortgage. Additionally, it tracks the client's credit score, which currently stands at 780, reflecting their financial reliability. The comprehensive nature of this database ensures that all relevant financial activities are systematically recorded, providing a robust foundation for credit risk assessment and management across the banking sector.
