In the financial sector, entities such as Moody's, S&P Global, and Fitch Ratings are recognized for their role in evaluating the creditworthiness of various entities. These three organizations collectively represent a significant portion of the industry, with each maintaining extensive databases on credit ratings. For instance, Moody's updates its credit rating information every 30 days, ensuring that the data reflects the most recent financial health of the rated entities. S&P Global, on the other hand, records entries at a bi-weekly interval, providing a more frequent update cycle. Fitch Ratings aligns closely with Moody's, updating its entries on a monthly basis. The specific entry times for these updates are meticulously logged; for example, Moody's entries are typically recorded at 10:00 AM EST on the first business day of each month, while S&P Global's entries are logged at 9:30 AM EST every other Monday. Fitch Ratings follows a similar pattern, with entries made at 11:00 AM EST on the last business day of each month. This structured approach ensures that the credit rating information is not only accurate but also timely, facilitating informed decision-making across the financial landscape. Each agency's database contains detailed records, including the date and time of each entry, which are crucial for tracking changes and trends in creditworthiness over time.
