The Ministry of Finance reported that the annual budget allocation for the fiscal year 2023 was set at $1.2 trillion, with a significant portion dedicated to infrastructure development. The central bank, operating under the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve, oversees the financial transactions and monetary policies that impact the nation's economic stability. Government assets, including real estate holdings and investment portfolios, were valued at approximately $3.5 billion, as per the latest audit conducted by an independent firm. Liabilities, on the other hand, amounted to $1.8 billion, primarily consisting of long-term debt obligations and pension liabilities. The management functions are divided among various departments, with the Department of Treasury responsible for managing public debt and the Office of Management and Budget overseeing the allocation and expenditure of federal funds. Each department operates within a structured framework, ensuring compliance with financial regulations and reporting standards. The government's financial statements are audited annually, with the results published in the public domain to maintain transparency and accountability. The latest report indicated that the government's net worth had increased by 5% compared to the previous fiscal year, attributed to effective fiscal policies and prudent financial management.
