The contractual agreement, identified by document number 456789, specifies that the effective commencement of the term is on January 15, 2023. This term is set to conclude on January 14, 2028, marking the termination date. Throughout this duration, the method for determining the settlement of interest payments is outlined as monthly compounding. The basis for calculating the interest is anchored to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), specifically the one-month LIBOR rate as published on the first business day of each calendar month. The period over which interest is computed and applied to the principal amount is defined on a quarterly basis, with each period commencing on the first day of the quarter and concluding on the last day of the quarter, aligning with the standard calendar quarters of the fiscal year. These parameters are meticulously detailed in clause 3.2 of the agreement, ensuring clarity and consistency in the financial obligations and expectations of the involved parties. The document further stipulates that any adjustments to the interest rates will be communicated in writing at least 30 days prior to the implementation of the new rate, as per the regulatory guidelines outlined in appendix B.
