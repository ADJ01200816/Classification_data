The multinational corporation, identified as XYZ Holdings, operates with a complex organizational structure that delineates clear hierarchical identification across its various entities. At the apex of this structure is the head office, situated in New York City, which oversees strategic decision-making and governance. This central hub is supported by multiple branch offices located in major cities such as London, Tokyo, and Sydney, each responsible for regional operations and compliance with local regulations. Within these branch offices, distinct departments are established, including Finance, Human Resources, Marketing, and IT, each tasked with specific operational functions. Additionally, XYZ Holdings owns several subsidiaries, such as ABC Technologies in Silicon Valley, specializing in software development, and DEF Logistics in Hamburg, focused on supply chain management.

Each department within the head office and branch offices is headed by a director who reports to the executive team at the head office, ensuring cohesive alignment with the corporation's overarching goals.
