The individual in question is associated with several financial institutions, each of which maintains custody over their assets through entrusted asset custody contracts. Within these agreements, a variety of data points are collected and recorded, pertaining to the assets themselves and the associated custody business data. This includes specific details such as the entrusted asset custody, trust asset custody, and other pertinent financial information. For instance, the principal involved holds a certain amount of assets that are managed under these arrangements, and the corresponding business data reflects transactions, account balances, and other financial activities. Furthermore, personal identifiers like phone numbers might be recorded in the system for communication purposes. The income situation of the principal, which could be reflected in their salary, is not explicitly disclosed but would be a part of the broader financial information held within the records. The tax obligations of the principal are also noted, indicating the amount of taxes paid in a given period, which could be calculated based on their income and applicable tax laws. However, specific details such as the name, gender, or nationality of the principal are not directly recorded in the data, ensuring a level of privacy is maintained in compliance with data protection regulations.
