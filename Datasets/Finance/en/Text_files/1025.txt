In this dataset, a series of weak privacy, personal biometric sample data has been recorded. Specifically, a face sample with unique features is provided, along with voiceprint, gait pattern, and detailed ear and eye print data. Additionally, a handwriting sample has been captured. Each piece of biometric information is associated with specific identifiers that represent different aspects of the individual's identity. For instance, a particular voiceprint may correspond to an individual whose monthly salary is recorded as 50,000 units, indicating a certain income level. Concurrently, the tax paid by this individual amounts to 8,000 units. The associated data includes gender-specific attributes and nationality information. However, it is important to note that this description does not reveal the individual's full name or other sensitive personal details.
