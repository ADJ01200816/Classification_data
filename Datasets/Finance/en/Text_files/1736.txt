On March 15, 2023, a financial institution in Beijing issued a series of government securities, specifically categorized under the 10-year fixed-rate treasury bonds. Each bond had a face value of 100,000 RMB and an annual interest rate of 3.5%. The issuance was conducted through an auction process, where bids were submitted electronically via the National Interbank Funding Center. The total amount issued was 5 billion RMB, with individual investors and institutional buyers participating. Redemption information indicated that these bonds would mature on March 15, 2033, with interest payments made annually on the anniversary of the issuance date. The redemption would be processed through the same electronic platform, ensuring seamless transactions for all parties involved. The sales method employed was a competitive bidding process, where the highest bidders were allocated the bonds until the entire issuance amount was reached. This method ensured a fair and transparent distribution of the securities among interested investors. The specific treasury bond type, known as "GB2023-10YR," was clearly marked in all transaction documents to avoid any confusion during the buying, holding, and redemption phases. Each transaction was accompanied by a unique identification number, which facilitated tracking and record-keeping for both the issuing institution and the investors. The detailed terms and conditions, including the specific redemption procedures and interest calculation methods, were outlined in the official prospectus provided to all participants prior to the auction. This comprehensive approach ensured that all stakeholders were fully informed and compliant with the regulatory requirements governing the issuance and redemption of treasury bonds in the Chinese financial market.
