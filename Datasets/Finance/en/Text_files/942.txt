He is part of a familial structure where his sister, Jane Doe, operates a local bakery, "Doe's Delights," which employs five family members, including their parents, Michael and Elizabeth Doe. The bakery's annual revenue stands at $300,000, with a net profit of $50,000, from which $10,000 is reinvested into the business.
