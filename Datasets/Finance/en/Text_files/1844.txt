The document issuance process involves the collection of various application details, including personal identification information. During the review phase, specific data points are meticulously examined. The issuance information encompasses the details of the document itself, such as its unique identifier and validity period. Verification information is gathered to ensure the authenticity of the application, and handover information outlines the procedures for delivering the document to the applicant. The application information includes personal details like date of birth, which helps in determining the age of the applicant. The review information might involve checking the applicant's gender, which is indicated by a binary code (e.g., M for male, F for female). Nationality is identified through a country code (e.g., CN for China) and is recorded in the issuance information. The applicant's income situation is assessed using financial data, such as monthly salary (e.g., 50,000 yuan), and this figure is used to calculate the tax liability (e.g., 8,000 yuan). Contact information, such as a telephone number, is also collected as part of the application process and is stored in the verification information section.
