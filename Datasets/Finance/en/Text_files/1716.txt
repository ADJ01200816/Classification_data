In the course of claims investigation, the adjuster initiated a comprehensive review by first conducting document verification. The documents presented included a driver's license issued to John Doe, a male individual, indicating his citizenship in the United States. The monthly income statement revealed earnings of $7,000, with corresponding tax deductions amounting to $1,400. The adjuster then proceeded with an on-site investigation at the accident location, where the property damage was assessed. The vehicle, a 2020 Toyota Camry, sustained significant front-end damage, estimated at $5,000 in repairs.

Simultaneously, an online investigation was carried out to cross-reference the provided information. Social media profiles and public records confirmed John Doe's residency and employment status. To further validate the findings, third-party cooperation investigation was engaged, involving a local law enforcement agency that provided a detailed accident report. This report included witness statements and photographs of the scene.

Investigation through other channels involved contacting John Doe's employer, ABC Corporation, to verify his employment and income details. The HR department confirmed his salary and tax contributions, aligning with the submitted documents. The investigation report compiled all gathered data, including the property damage situation and personnel injury situation. It noted that John Doe suffered a minor leg injury, requiring medical attention costing $800.

The cause of the accident was determined to be a rear-end collision due to sudden braking by the vehicle in front. The accident liability was assessed, with John Doe being found 30% at fault. In conjunction with these findings, a third-party accident investigation firm was consulted to provide an independent analysis, which corroborated the initial conclusions. The comprehensive investigation ensured all aspects of the claim were thoroughly examined and validated.
