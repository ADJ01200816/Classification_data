In the comprehensive dataset compiled for the urban development analysis, the specific metric labeled as "Residential Property Price Index" is updated on a monthly basis. This indicator reflects the fluctuations in housing costs across various metropolitan areas. For instance, in the city of Beijing, the index recorded a value of 128.3 in January, which incremented to 129.7 by the end of February. Concurrently, the "Commercial Real Estate Vacancy Rate" is monitored quarterly, providing insights into the utilization of office spaces. In Shanghai, this rate stood at 12.5% in the first quarter, witnessing a slight decrease to 11.8% in the subsequent quarter. These precise measurements are integral for stakeholders to gauge market trends and formulate investment strategies. Additionally, the "Land Transaction Volume" metric, which is documented annually, indicated that in 2022, the total area of land traded in Guangzhou amounted to 2.4 million square meters, compared to 2.1 million square meters in the preceding year. These data points collectively contribute to a nuanced understanding of the real estate sector's performance.
