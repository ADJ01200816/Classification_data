The basic profile record data of the financial institution includes several key pieces of information. Firstly, the institution number, which is a unique identifier for the organization, is crucial for internal tracking and external referencing. The institution name provides a clear label for the organization, allowing for easy recognition and distinction from others. The institution address includes the physical location of the organization, which is important for visitors, deliveries, and legal purposes. Additionally, the institution phone number serves as a point of contact for inquiries, transactions, and customer service. The organizational structure of the institution is composed of various internal departments that work together to achieve the institution's goals. These departments may include risk management, compliance, finance, and customer service. Branch offices are physical locations that extend the reach of the institution, providing services to a wider customer base. Each branch office would have its own basic profile record data, mirroring the information of the main institution but with specific details for that location.
