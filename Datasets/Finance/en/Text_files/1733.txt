On the 15th of March 2023, the People's Bank of China issued an official directive labeled as "AML-2023-045" to all domestic banks and non-banking financial entities. This directive emphasized the reinforcement of existing anti-money laundering protocols, particularly focusing on enhanced due diligence for high-risk clients. The notice mandated that institutions must report any suspicious transactions exceeding 1 million yuan within 24 hours of detection. It also outlined specific measures for cross-border transactions, requiring detailed records of all transactions involving foreign currencies, especially those involving the US dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. Additionally, the directive stipulated that all financial institutions must establish a dedicated anti-money laundering department by the end of the second quarter of 2023. This department is required to conduct monthly audits and submit comprehensive reports to the central regulatory authority. The notice further highlighted the importance of seamless communication channels between different financial entities, promoting the use of a centralized information-sharing platform. This platform is designed to facilitate real-time exchange of suspicious activity reports and other relevant data, ensuring a cohesive approach to combating financial crimes. The directive also included a provision for quarterly anti-money laundering training sessions for all personnel involved in customer-facing roles, aiming to enhance their ability to identify and report potential money laundering activities.
