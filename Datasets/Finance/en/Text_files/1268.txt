The system in question is equipped with advanced application software designed to manage and secure network operations. Within the computer room facilities, a monitoring platform is implemented to oversee the system's performance. The platform collects and analyzes log data, which includes details such as recording time and recording date. This data is crucial for identifying any anomalies or potential security breaches. When an alarm is triggered, the system categorizes the alarm type and determines the alarm level, indicating the severity of the issue. Additionally, diagnostic information is generated to assist in troubleshooting and resolving the problem. The data collected is stored securely and is used to maintain the integrity and functionality of the system.
