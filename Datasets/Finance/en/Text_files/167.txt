John Doe, a male resident of the United States, engages in the practice of re-lending funds. He maintains a detailed record of his re-lending activities, which includes specific data points such as the amount of money re-lent, the duration of each re-lending transaction, and the repayment schedules. For instance, in the month of June 2023, he re-lent $15,000 to a borrower with a repayment term of 12 months. The re-lending interest rate for this particular transaction was set at 7.5% per annum. Additionally, John uses an online platform to manage the information related to his re-lending business, ensuring that all payment settlements are accurately recorded and processed. The platform also tracks the purpose of each re-lending transaction, such as funding a small business venture or covering personal expenses. For example, one of his recent re-lending activities was aimed at supporting a local startup, with a detailed breakdown of the payment settlement dates and amounts. The transparency in his documentation allows for clear auditing and ensures compliance with financial regulations.
