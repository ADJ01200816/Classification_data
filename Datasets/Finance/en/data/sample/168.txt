It looks like you're referring to terms related to finance and banking, particularly those associated with discounting bills and settlement processes in the context of business transactions. Here's a brief explanation of the terms you've mentioned:

1. **Discounting Business**: This generally refers to the practice where a business or financial institution purchases a bill of exchange or promissory note before its maturity date at a discounted price. The purpose is to provide the holder of the bill with immediate liquidity, less the discount fee.

   - **Bill Discounting**: The process where a business sells its invoices to a third party (a bank or a financial institution) at a discount. This provides the business with immediate cash instead of waiting for the invoice to be paid by the debtor.

2. **Information**: In the financial context, information is critical for making decisions about discounting and other financial transactions. It includes data on creditworthiness, market conditions, interest rates, and the financial health of the parties involved.

3. **Payment Settlement**: The process by which two parties, typically a creditor and a debtor, fulfill their obligations regarding the payment of a bill, invoice, or debt. Settlement can occur on the due date or through a discounted payment if the creditor agrees to receive a reduced amount.

   - **Bill Direct Discount**: This could refer to a situation where a bill is discounted directly with a financial institution without any intermediaries.

4. **Business Information**: Comprehensive data and details about a company's operations, financial status, and other relevant information that may be used for due diligence, risk assessment, and decision-making processes.

5. **Bill Direct Discount Interest Rate**: The rate of interest applied when a bill is discounted directly. This is the cost of obtaining immediate funds by selling the bill before maturity at a discount.

6. **Rediscount Bill Number**: When a bill that has already been discounted once is discounted a second time, this is known as rediscounting. The **rediscount bill number** would be the unique identifier for the bill that is being rediscounted. This is typically done by banks to manage their liquidity needs.

In the context of these terms, businesses often engage in discounting bills to manage their cash flow, especially when they need funds quickly and cannot wait for the full payment term. Financial institutions provide this service and charge interest on the discounted amount, which is the cost of the convenience provided.
