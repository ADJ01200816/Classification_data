In the context of a loan business, the terms you've mentioned pertain to the process of extending or modifying a loan agreement. Here's an explanation of each term:

1. **Loan Business**: This refers to the financial institution or lender that provides loans to individuals or entities in exchange for interest payments and the repayment of the principal amount borrowed.

2. **Extension**: This is when a borrower and a lender agree to modify the existing terms of a loan, typically to extend the time period over which the borrower is required to repay the loan.

   - **Extension Period**: This is the additional period of time granted to the borrower to repay the loan. For example, if a loan was originally due in 36 months and is extended for another 12 months, the extension period would be 12 months.

   - **Extension Interest Rate**: This is the new interest rate that applies to the loan for the extension period. It may be the same as the original interest rate, higher, or sometimes lower, depending on the negotiations and the lender's policies.

   - **Extension Amount**: This is the total amount that is subject to the extension, which could include the remaining balance of the loan or any additional funds that are being borrowed as part of the extension.

   - **Extension Frequency**: This refers to how often the lender and borrower have agreed to review the possibility of extending the loan terms. It could be a one-time event or a recurring option depending on the agreement.

   - **Extension Reason**: This is the purpose or motivation for seeking an extension. Common reasons include financial hardship, changes in the borrower's financial circumstances, or a need for additional time to generate the funds required to repay the loan.

When negotiating an extension, the lender will consider the borrower's creditworthiness, payment history, and the reason for the extension request. Extensions are often subject to the same credit checks and approval processes as the original loan, and they may also involve additional fees or charges. It's important for both parties to clearly understand the terms of the extension and to document them in a loan modification agreement.
