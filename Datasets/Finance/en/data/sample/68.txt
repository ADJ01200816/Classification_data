You seem to be listing various entities and activities related to the financial industry, specifically those focusing on fund management and investment. Let's break down the roles and functions of each:

1. **Commercial Banks**: These are banks that provide services to individuals and businesses, such as taking deposits, providing loans, and offering various financial services. They also play a role in the investment sector by sometimes offering fund management services.

   - **Fund Management Companies**: These companies specialize in managing investment funds. They pool money from various investors and invest it in securities like stocks, bonds, and other assets according to the fund's investment objectives.

2. **Funds**:
   - **Investment Funds**: These can refer to mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, etc. They collect money from investors and use it to buy securities or other assets.
   - **Fund of Funds**: These are investment vehicles that invest in other funds rather than investing directly in stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments.

3. **Settlement Funds**: These funds are used to facilitate the settlement of trades. When an investor buys or sells securities, the money or securities change hands through a settlement process. Settlement funds ensure the smooth transfer of assets and cash.

4. **Accounting in Fund Management**: This involves the recording, classifying, and reporting of a fund's financial transactions. It includes maintaining the fund's books, calculating net asset value (NAV), and preparing financial statements.

5. **Fund Valuation**: This is the process of determining the price or value of a fund's investments. Valuation is crucial for calculating the NAV of the fund and ensuring that investors can buy and sell shares at a fair price.

6. **Management Supervision**: This refers to the oversight of fund management activities. It includes ensuring that the fund is being managed in line with its objectives and regulatory requirements, and that investors' interests are being protected.

7. **Investment Operations**: This encompasses the day-to-day activities involved in managing a fund's investments. It includes trade execution, settlement of trades, portfolio accounting, and compliance with investment guidelines.

8. **Investment Fund Custody Business**: Custody services involve the safekeeping of a fund's assets. This includes holding securities, handling corporate actions, and providing other services to ensure the assets are secure and accounted for.

In the financial industry, especially in the context of fund management, these activities are subject to strict regulatory oversight to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Each of these roles is essential for the smooth and transparent functioning of the investment fund ecosystem.
