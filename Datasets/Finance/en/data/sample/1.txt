It seems like you're listing various categories of personal financial information. In many countries, including China, these details are considered sensitive and are protected by law. Here's a brief explanation of what each category might entail:

1. Personal data: This includes an individualâ€™s name, ID number, contact information, and other identifying details.
   
2. Property data: Information about properties owned by an individual, including land, real estate, and other assets.

3. Personal income status: The total income of a person from all sources, including wages, salaries, investments, and business profits.

4. Real estate status: Details about any real estate owned by an individual, such as location, value, and whether there are any mortgages or liens on the property.

5. Vehicle status: Information about any vehicles owned, including the make, model, year, and whether there is a loan on the vehicle.

6. Tax amount: The total amount of tax paid by an individual to the government, which can include income tax, property tax, and other applicable taxes.

7. Provident fund deposit amount: A savings plan for retirement, common in some countries, where both the employee and employer contribute a certain percentage of the employee's salary.

8. Personal social security: Details about an individual's social security benefits or contributions, which are designed to provide financial assistance in the event of disability, old age, or unemployment.

9. Medical insurance deposit amount: The amount of money paid into a medical insurance plan by an individual, which can be used to cover healthcare expenses.

In China, such information is protected under the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) and other relevant laws. Individuals and organizations that handle such data must comply with these regulations, which include obtaining consent for collecting personal data, ensuring data security, and limiting the use of the data to the purposes for which it was collected.
