Non-bank payment institutions and the related regulatory services are a critical part of the financial ecosystem, especially in today's digital economy. Below, I will explain the concepts you've mentioned in relation to these institutions:

### Non-bank Payment Institutions
These are financial entities that provide payment services but are not traditional banks. They include, for example, mobile payment providers, money transfer services, and digital wallet operators. Non-bank payment institutions have gained popularity due to their convenience and accessibility.

### Non-on-site Regulatory Services
This refers to regulatory oversight that does not require physical presence or on-site inspections. In the context of non-bank payment institutions, this might mean remote monitoring, data reporting, and analysis conducted by regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with financial regulations and to manage risks.

### Asset Liability Indicators of Non-bank Payment Institutions
These indicators are financial metrics used to assess the health and stability of non-bank payment institutions. They include:

- **Assets:** What the institution owns, such as cash, investments, and receivables.
- **Liabilities:** What the institution owes, such as deposits from customers and borrowings.
- **Capital Adequacy Ratios:** Measures of the institution's capital in relation to its risk-weighted assets.
- **Liquidity Ratios:** Indicators of the institution's ability to meet short-term obligations.

### Audit Information
Audit information is the detailed financial data and documentation that is reviewed during an audit. For non-bank payment institutions, this includes:

- Financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements).
- Compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Internal controls and risk management processes.

### Net Value of Fixed Assets
The net value of fixed assets is the book value of all fixed assets (like property, plant, and equipment) minus accumulated depreciation. This figure provides an indication of the investment the institution has in long-term assets.

### Paid-in Capital Amount
Paid-in capital, also known as contributed capital, is the total amount of capital that shareholders have invested in a company. In the context of non-bank payment institutions, this represents the initial investment by the owners or shareholders to capitalize the business. It's an important indicator of the financial strength and stability of the institution.

Regulatory authorities closely monitor these indicators to ensure the safety and soundness of non-bank payment institutions, as they play an increasingly important role in the global financial system.
