The establishment located at 123 Maple Street, known as "Green Leaf Emporium," operates under the management of its central hub situated in downtown Springfield. This particular outlet, identified as Branch #45, has been functional since 2010 and is one of the twelve regional extensions of the main enterprise. Within its premises, there are six distinct counters, each specializing in various product categories such as electronics, apparel, and gourmet foods. Counter A, positioned near the entrance, handles high-end electronics and is staffed by three personnel during peak hours. 

Adjacent to Counter A, Counter B is designated for premium apparel and accessories, featuring brands like Polo and Gucci. The self-service equipment installed beside Counter C includes digital kiosks that allow customers to browse inventory, make purchases, and arrange for home deliveries without staff intervention. These kiosks, managed by an internal software system, have been operational since January 2021 and have significantly reduced checkout times.

In addition to traditional retail services, Branch #45 offers insurance direct sales through Counter D, where licensed agents from "SecureLife Insurance Co." are available from 10 AM to 6 PM on weekdays. This partnership, initiated in March 2019, has facilitated the sale of over 500 insurance policies within the branch's vicinity. 

For customer inquiries and feedback, the contact information displayed at each counter includes a toll-free number, 1-800-123-4567, and an email address, support@greenleafemporium.com. The branch also maintains a local contact number, (555) 987-6543, specifically for issues requiring immediate on-site assistance. The location's accessibility is further enhanced by its proximity to the Springfield Metro Station, approximately 500 meters to the north, and three bus routes that have stops directly in front of the establishment.
