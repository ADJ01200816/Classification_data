ABC Financial Technology Co., Ltd., incorporated in the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China, is an entity registered under the regulatory framework governed by the People's Bank of China. The company's operations are subject to periodic assessments conducted by the central regulatory authority. During the last fiscal quarter, an audit was initiated to scrutinize the firm's compliance with statutory reserve requirements. The examination encompassed detailed records pertaining to liquidity maintenance, focusing on specific metrics such as the reserve ratio maintenance levels.

Documented evidence indicated that ABC Financial Technology Co., Ltd. maintained a total of 15 separate reserve custody accounts as of the reporting date, December 31, 2022. These accounts were domiciled across various state-owned and private banking institutions, including Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank. Each account was meticulously tracked for its monthly inflows and outflows to ensure adherence to the stipulated reserve thresholds.

The review further unveiled that the aggregate ending balance of these reserve custody accounts stood at 875 million yuan. This figure was arrived at after accounting for all transactions recorded up to the close of business on the aforementioned date. The breakdown of the balances revealed variances, with individual account balances ranging from a minimum of 15 million yuan to a maximum of 150 million yuan, reflecting the diverse operational scales and transaction volumes managed by the company.

Additionally, the analysis of reserve indicators showcased a consistent compliance rate of 98.5% over the preceding six-month period. This metric was calculated based on the ratio of actual reserves held against the mandated reserve requirements as prescribed by the regulatory guidelines. The minor deviations noted were promptly addressed through corrective measures, ensuring that the company remained in good standing with the regulatory directives.

The comprehensive review also highlighted the company's proactive stance in managing its liquidity positions, evident from the regular reconciliation reports submitted to the regulatory authorities. These reports provided granular insights into the daily, weekly, and monthly fluctuations in the reserve balances, thereby demonstrating the company's commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance. The data points were meticulously cross-verified against the bank statements and internal ledger records to ensure accuracy and integrity of the reported figures.
