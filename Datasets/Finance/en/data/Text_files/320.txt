It seems like you might be referring to a series of related terms that would be used in the context of managing insurance policy payments. Below is an explanation of each term:

1. **Customer**: This refers to the individual or entity that holds an insurance policy with an insurance company. The customer is responsible for paying the insurance premium to maintain their coverage.

2. **Insurance Premium**: This is the amount of money an insurance policyholder pays to the insurance company in exchange for the coverage provided by the insurance policy. Premiums can be paid on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis.

3. **Payment Items**: In the context of insurance, payment items would refer to the individual charges that make up the total amount due for an insurance policy. This could include the premium for the policy, any fees or taxes, and additional charges depending on the terms of the policy.

4. **Payment Account**: This is the financial account from which a customer initiates a payment. It could be a checking account, savings account, or a credit/debit card account that the customer uses to pay their insurance premium.

5. **Amount**: This term refers to the specific dollar amount that is due for payment. For insurance premiums, this would be the total cost that the customer needs to pay to keep their insurance policy in force.

6. **Payment Channel**: This is the method or medium through which the customer makes their payment. Payment channels can include online banking, electronic funds transfer (EFT), credit/debit card payments, bank drafts, over-the-counter payments at a bank, or even checks sent by mail.

7. **Payment Date**: This is the date on which the payment is processed or initiated. It is the specific day that the funds are debited from the customer's payment account and credited to the insurance company's account. The payment date is important for ensuring that the premium is paid by the due date to avoid a lapse in coverage. 

Understanding and keeping track of these items is essential for both the customer and the insurance company to ensure that the insurance policy remains active and that the customer is protected by the insurance coverage they've purchased.
