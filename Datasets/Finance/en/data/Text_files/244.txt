It seems like you're referring to various terms associated with banking services, specifically related to the withdrawal of small denominations of cash. Here's a breakdown of what each term might mean:

1. **Small Denomination Cash Withdrawal Reservation:**
This term likely refers to a service provided by a bank or an ATM where a customer can reserve a specific amount of cash in small denominations (such as $20 bills) to be withdrawn at a later time. This reservation can be made through online banking, a mobile app, or sometimes directly at an ATM.

2. **Small Denomination Withdrawal Reservation Number:**
This would be a unique identifier assigned to a specific reservation made for withdrawing small denominations of cash. The reservation number serves as a reference for both the bank and the customer to track the transaction. It can be used to confirm the reservation, cancel it, or inquire about its status.

3. **Small Denomination Pending Transaction Time:**
This refers to the duration between the time a customer makes a reservation for a small denomination cash withdrawal and the time the transaction is completed or the cash is actually picked up. The "pending" status indicates that the transaction has not yet been fully processed. The pending transaction time can vary based on the bank's policies and the specifics of the reservation.

Here are some additional details:

- **Pending Transaction Time:** This could range from a few hours to a few days, depending on the bank's processing times and whether the reservation is made during business hours or on a weekend/holiday.

- **Reservation Expiration:** Typically, if the cash is not withdrawn within a certain timeframe, the reservation may expire, and the reserved amount may be released back to general circulation.

- **Cancellation:** Customers may also have the option to cancel the reservation before the cash is withdrawn.

It's important to note that these services might vary greatly between financial institutions, and it's best to check with your specific bank for details on how these processes work for your accounts.
