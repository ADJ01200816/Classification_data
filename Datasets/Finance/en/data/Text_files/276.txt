The payment settlement process in business involves the transfer of funds from a payer to a payee in exchange for goods, services, or other financial obligations. This process typically involves various business accounts and may require accounting adjustments to ensure that financial statements reflect the true financial position of a company. Below are details regarding business accounts involved, accounting adjustment dates, and types of accounting adjustments related to payment settlements.

### Business Accounts Involved in Payment Settlement:

1. **Cash/Bank Account:** This account records the inflow and outflow of cash and checks resulting from payment settlements.
   
2. **Accounts Receivable:** Represents amounts owed to the business by customers for goods or services provided on credit.
   
3. **Accounts Payable:** Reflects amounts the business owes to suppliers or creditors for goods or services received but not yet paid for.
   
4. **Revenue/Sales Account:** Where revenue from the sale of goods or services is recorded when the transaction occurs, irrespective of when the payment is settled.
   
5. **Inventory Account:** This account is impacted when payment is settled for inventory that has been sold.
   
6. **Tax Liabilities:** This includes sales tax or other transaction taxes collected from customers and to be remitted to the tax authorities.
   
7. **Deferred Revenue:** When payment is received in advance for goods or services that are yet to be delivered, this account is adjusted.

### Accounting Adjustment Dates:

Accounting adjustments can occur at various times depending on the business’s accounting period, the nature of the transaction, and the accounting principles being followed (such as accrual accounting or cash accounting).

1. **Periodic Adjustments:** These are typically made at the end of an accounting period (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually) to ensure that financial statements are accurate.
   
2. **Year-End Adjustments:** These are adjustments made specifically at the end of the fiscal year to finalize the accounts for financial reporting purposes.
   
3. **Real-time Adjustments:** Some adjustments may be made in real-time as transactions occur, especially when using sophisticated accounting software that tracks and adjusts accounts continuously.

### Types of Accounting Adjustments:

1. **Accruals:** Recognizing revenue or expenses before cash is received or paid. For example, interest revenue accrues over time, and even if not yet received, it will be recorded as accrued revenue.
   
2. **Deferrals:** Deferring the recognition of revenue or expenses when cash is received or paid before the revenue is earned or the expense is incurred. For example, prepaid insurance is a deferral.
   
3. **Depreciation and Amortization:** Allocating the cost of long-term assets (like buildings, equipment) or intangible assets (like patents) over their useful lives.
   
4. **Inventory Adjustments:** Adjusting the value of inventory for factors such as obsolescence, damage, or to reflect actual market values.
   
5. **Bad Debt Expenses:** Estimating and recording the amount of receivables that are expected to be uncollectible.
   
6. **Tax Adjustments:** Adjusting for taxes that have been incurred but not yet paid, or taxes collected but not yet remitted.
   
7. **Non-cash Transactions:** Adjusting for transactions that do not involve cash, such as converting debt to equity.
   
8. **Correction of Errors:** Adjustments made to correct errors in the accounting records from previous periods.

Each of these adjustments is important to ensure that the financial statements present a true and fair view of the company’s financial position and performance, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and principles.
