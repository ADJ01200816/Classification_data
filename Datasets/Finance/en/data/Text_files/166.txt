To provide detailed information about an account that includes the amount, balance, and currency, I would need specific data from a particular financial account. However, since I don't have access to personal or private databases, I can't retrieve or provide actual account information.

But I can explain what each term means in the context of a financial account:

- **Amount**: This usually refers to a specific sum of money that is either deposited, withdrawn, or transferred in relation to the account. Amounts can be associated with different transactions such as purchases, payments, deposits, or withdrawals.

- **Balance**: The balance of an account is the total amount of money present in the account at any given time. It reflects all transactions that have cleared and is a real-time indicator of how much the account holder can use or owes (in the case of a credit account). The balance can be a credit balance (positive, indicating money available or owed to the account holder) or a debit balance (negative, indicating money owed by the account holder).

- **Currency**: This refers to the type of money that is used for transactions and that the account is denominated in. For instance, USD for United States Dollars, EUR for Euros, GBP for British Pounds, etc. The currency is important as it determines the value of the amount and balance in the global market and affects transactions involving international transfers or exchanges.

If you need to know the specific amount, balance, and currency of a personal or business account, you would typically check the account statement provided by your financial institution or use online banking services to view the account details securely. If you're working with a dataset or a hypothetical example, you would simply refer to the respective fields in your data that represent these values.
