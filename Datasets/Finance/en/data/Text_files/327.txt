It seems you are listing various elements that could be associated with a retail or service-oriented business, such as a store that offers insurance direct sales. Below is an explanation of each term and how they may relate to a business setting:

1. **Store**: A retail establishment where goods and services are sold to customers. This could be a physical location or an online platform.

2. **Branch**: A secondary location of a business that operates under the same brand and business model as the primary location. In the context of a store, a branch would be an additional store that is part of a chain.

3. **Counter**: A long flat surface over which goods are displayed or business is conducted in a store. Counters are often used in retail for transactions, customer service, and as a workspace for employees.

4. **Self-service equipment**: Machines or kiosks that allow customers to perform certain tasks without the assistance of a staff member. Examples include self-checkout machines, ticket vending machines, or self-service information kiosks.

5. **Insurance Direct Sales**: A sales model where insurance products are sold directly to consumers without the involvement of intermediaries such as agents or brokers. This can happen through a store, over the phone, or online.

6. **Store Name**: The name of the store, which is a key part of its brand identity. For example, "XYZ Insurance Store."

7. **Counter Name**: If a store has multiple counters for different services, each counter might have a specific name to identify its purpose. For instance, a "Customer Service Counter" or "Claims Counter."

8. **Location**: The geographical address of the store or branch, which can include the street address, city, state, and country.

9. **Contact Information**: The means by which customers or other parties can get in touch with the store or branch. This can include a phone number, email address, website URL, and social media handles.

For a concrete example, let's fictionalize a detail for each element:

- **Store Name**: SecureFuture Insurance Superstore
- **Branch**: SecureFuture Insurance Superstore - Downtown Branch
- **Counter Name**: QuickClaim Desk
- **Location**: 456 Main Street, Hometown, State, 12345
- **Contact Information**: 
  - Phone: (555) 123-4567
  - Email: info@securefutureinsurance.com
  - Website: www.securefutureinsurance.com

The self-service equipment in this context might be "Insurance Policy Renewal Kiosks" placed within the store for customer convenience, and the counter would be where customers go if they need to speak with someone about filing a claim or getting policy information.
