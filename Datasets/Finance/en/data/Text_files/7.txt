It seems like you're inquiring about the components that typically appear on a qualification certificate. Here's a breakdown of what these terms mean:

1. **Qualification Certificate**: This is a document that confirms that an individual has completed a certain level of training or has met specific criteria to be considered qualified in a particular field, skill, or profession.

The elements that are usually found on a qualification certificate include:

2. **Number**: A unique identifier for the certificate, which can be used for verification purposes. This number is often sequential or contains information specific to the individual and the issuing institution.

3. **Issuing Institution**: The organization, educational institution, or agency that is authorized to issue the certificate. This could be a government body, a professional association, a university, or a training provider recognized in the field.

4. **Effective Date**: The date from which the certificate is considered valid. This is usually the date on which the certificate is issued or, in some cases, the date on which the qualifications were confirmed or achieved.

5. **Expiration Date**: The date on which the certificate's validity ends. Some qualifications require periodic renewal, such as through ongoing education or re-assessment, to ensure that the individual's skills and knowledge remain current. Not all certificates have expiration dates, especially those that are issued for qualifications that do not require renewal.

For example, a First Aid Certificate might look like this:

- **Qualification Certificate**: First Aid Certification
- **Number**: 123456789
- **Issuing Institution**: American Red Cross
- **Effective Date**: January 15, 2023
- **Expiration Date**: January 14, 2025

Please note that the information provided on a certificate can vary depending on the country, the nature of the qualification, and the policies of the issuing institution.
