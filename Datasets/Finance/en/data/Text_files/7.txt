It seems like you're inquiring about the components of a typical qualification certificate. Here's a breakdown of the terms you've mentioned:

1. **Qualification Certificate**: This is a document that serves as official confirmation that an individual has met certain standards or requirements in a particular field, skill, or profession. It is often awarded after passing an examination, completing a training program, or achieving a specific level of proficiency.

   Examples include professional certifications, academic degrees, or Statements of Attainment for vocational qualifications.

2. **Number**: This is a unique identifier assigned to the certificate to ensure its authenticity. The number can be used for record-keeping and verification purposes.

3. **Issuing Institution**: This is the entity that is authorized to issue the certificate. It could be a government agency, a professional body, a university, a training organization, or any other institution recognized to assess and certify individuals in a particular area of expertise.

   Examples include the American Medical Association, Microsoft, or the various national departments of education.

4. **Effective Date**: This is the date from which the certificate becomes valid. In many cases, this is the date on which the certificate is awarded or issued. It indicates that, as of this date, the holder of the certificate has been deemed qualified.

5. **Expiration Date**: This is the date until which the certificate remains valid. Some qualifications do not expire, while others require periodic renewal to ensure that the holder maintains current knowledge and skills. For example, many professional certifications in the healthcare, IT, or aviation sectors have expiration dates and require ongoing education or re-examination to extend the validity of the certificate.

For example, a qualification certificate might look like this:

- Qualification: Certified Public Accountant (CPA)
- Certificate Number: CPA123456789
- Issuing Institution: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
- Effective Date: May 1, 2021
- Expiration Date: May 1, 2026

This information helps employers, regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders to verify the authenticity and validity of the qualification.
