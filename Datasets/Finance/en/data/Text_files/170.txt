It seems like you are referencing a list of attributes that might be associated with a database record for a digital wallet or a similar financial account. Hereâ€™s an explanation of each term:

1. **Wallet ID**: A unique identifier assigned to the wallet. This is typically a numeric or alphanumeric string that distinguishes this wallet from all others in the system.

2. **Wallet Type**: The category or class of the wallet, indicating the kind of wallet it is (e.g., personal, business, joint, savings, checking, etc.).

3. **Wallet Level**: This could refer to the tier or level of the wallet based on certain criteria, such as transaction limits, features available, or the level of verification required (e.g., basic, gold, platinum).

4. **Wallet Name**: A name assigned to the wallet by the user or the operating institution for easy identification. This could be a personal nickname or a default name based on the type of wallet.

5. **Wallet Operating Institution Number**: A number that identifies the financial institution or the service provider that operates the wallet. This could be a bank code, a routing number, or a similar identifier.

6. **Wallet Opening Date**: The date on which the wallet was opened or created. This is important for tracking the age of the wallet and for various regulatory or internal reporting purposes.

7. **Wallet Status**: The current state of the wallet, indicating whether it is active, inactive, frozen, closed, or any other status that the institution might use to indicate the operational state of the wallet.

Below is an example of how this information might be presented in a table format:

| Wallet ID       | Wallet Type | Wallet Level | Wallet Name       | Wallet Operating Institution Number | Wallet Opening Date | Wallet Status |
