1. Personal Data: This includes an individual's identifying information, such as name, address, date of birth, and contact details.

2. Property Data: Information about the properties an individual owns or has interest in, such as the location, value, size, and any liens or mortgages on the property.

3. Personal Income Status: This refers to an individual's annual, monthly, or other periodic income from all sources, including wages, salaries, investments, and business profits.

4. Real Estate Status: Details about an individual's real estate holdings, including whether they are the owner, co-owner, or have any mortgages or loans against the property.

5. Vehicle Status: Information regarding the vehicles an individual owns, including the make, model, year, and any outstanding loans or liens on the vehicle.

6. Tax Amount: The total amount of tax owed or paid by an individual to the government, usually based on their income, deductions, and credits.
