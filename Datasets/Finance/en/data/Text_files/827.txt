In an electronic document template file, the document definition document specifies the structured layout and data fields required for accurate information capture. The template begins with a section for personal identification, where the first field is designated for an individual's full legal name, such as "John Doe." Immediately following, a dropdown menu is provided to select the gender, with options including "Male," "Female," "Non-binary," and "Prefer not to say." The next field requires the input of the individual's nationality, for instance, "Canadian" or "Brazilian."

Moving to the financial details segment, the template includes a numeric field for monthly income, where values like "7,500 USD" or "50,000 EUR" can be entered. Adjacent to this, there is a specific field for annual tax contributions, which might record amounts such as "12,000 USD" or "25,000 EUR." These figures are crucial for assessing financial stability and compliance with tax regulations.

For contact information, the template allocates a space for a primary telephone number, formatted to accommodate international standards, such as "+1 (555) 123-4567" or "+49 170 1234567." Each field is accompanied by validation rules to ensure data integrity, such as length constraints for phone numbers and currency format checks for income and tax amounts. The document definition document also outlines mandatory fields and conditional logic, where certain sections may only appear based on previous inputs, ensuring a dynamic yet standardized data collection process.
