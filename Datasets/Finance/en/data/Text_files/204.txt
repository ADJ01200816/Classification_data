It seems like you're listing various components that are typically associated with an insurance policy. Below is an explanation of each term:

1. **Policy Number**: This is a unique identifier assigned by the insurer to the insurance policy. It is used for tracking and management of the policy by both the insurer and the policyholder.

2. **Insurer**: The insurance company that provides the insurance coverage and is responsible for paying out claims as per the terms of the policy.

3. **Policyholder**: The person or entity that purchases the insurance policy and has the right to make changes to the policy and is responsible for paying the premiums.

4. **Insured**: The individual(s) or entity whose life, health, property, or interests are covered by the insurance policy. This may or may not be the same as the policyholder.

5. **Beneficiary**: The person or entity designated to receive the proceeds of the insurance policy upon the death of the insured in the case of life insurance, or the benefits as defined in other types of insurance.

6. **Signing Date**: The date on which the policyholder and the insurer sign the insurance contract, indicating that both parties agree to the terms of the policy.

7. **Effective Date**: The date on which the insurance coverage provided by the policy begins. This could be the same as or different from the signing date, depending on the terms of the policy.

8. **Premium**: The amount of money the policyholder pays to the insurer for the insurance coverage. This is usually paid either monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.

9. **Payment Method**: The method by which the policyholder pays the premium, such as credit card, direct debit, check, or electronic funds transfer.

10. **Special Agreement**: Any additional terms or clauses that have been agreed upon by the insurer and the policyholder that are not part of the standard policy terms.

11. **Health Notification**: This refers to any requirement for the policyholder or insured to inform the insurer of any changes in health status or medical conditions that may affect the insurance coverage.

12. **Breach of Contract Liability**: Details of the insurer's and policyholder's rights and responsibilities in the event that one party fails to uphold the terms of the insurance contract.

13. **Dispute Resolution**: The process or methods outlined in the policy for resolving any disputes that may arise between the policyholder and the insurer. This might include negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or litigation.
