It seems you're referring to various financial terms and concepts that are related to commerce, banking, and the handling of financial instruments. Let's break down each term:

1. **Discounting Business**: This refers to the practice of selling accounts receivable (invoices) to a third party at a discount before their scheduled payment date. In this scenario, a business can receive immediate cash for its invoices instead of waiting for the customer to pay. The third party, often a financial institution, charges a fee for this service, which is essentially the discount.

2. **Payment Settlement**: This is the process of completing a transaction by transferring money or value between the parties involved. In business transactions, this often involves the transfer of funds from a buyer to a seller, clearing any outstanding debts and finalizing the deal. Payment settlement can occur through various methods such as electronic funds transfer, checks, credit card payments, or other forms of currency exchange.

3. **Business Information**: This is a broad term that refers to the data and knowledge that is critical to the operation and success of a business. This can include financial records, market research, customer data, sales figures, forecasts, and any other data that might influence business decisions.

4. **Bill Direct Interest Rate**: This term could refer to the interest rate that is directly applied to a bill of exchange or a promissory note. In the context of a bill of exchange, which is a written, unconditional, and signed instrument that instructs a party to pay a certain sum of money to the bearer, the direct interest rate would be the rate at which interest will be calculated if the bill is not paid by the maturity date.

5. **Rediscount Bill Number**: A rediscount is when a bank or financial institution discounts a bill that has already been discounted. This typically happens when the holder of a bill, which is due at a future date, needs liquidity before the maturity date and approaches a bank for a second discounting. The "rediscount bill number" would be a unique identifier for the financial instrument that is being rediscounted, allowing for clear tracking and record-keeping within the banking system.

Understanding these terms is crucial for businesses and financial institutions as they navigate the complexities of managing cash flow, settling payments, and utilizing financial instruments to optimize working capital.
