It seems like you are inquiring about different legal and judicial terms related to individuals who have been executed after being found guilty of a crime, as well as various types of announcements and records associated with legal proceedings. I will provide explanations for each term:

1. **Dishonest Executed Person**: This term is not typically used in a formal legal context, but it could refer to an individual who has been executed and who, prior to their execution, had engaged in dishonesty or deception as part of their criminal behavior. The concept of dishonesty could relate to crimes such as fraud or corruption.

2. **Executed Person**: This refers to someone who has been put to death by the state as a form of punishment after being convicted of a serious crime, such as murder or other capital offenses, depending on the jurisdiction. Execution is a legal penalty in some countries, although its use is declining globally.

3. **Court Announcement**: This is an official statement made by a court regarding a legal proceeding, judgment, or any other significant information pertaining to a case. These announcements are often made in open court, but they may also be published in legal bulletins, newspapers, or online.

4. **Filing Announcement**: This term could refer to a notification made to the public or relevant parties that a legal document has been filed with a court or other administrative body. For example, when a company files certain documents with a regulatory agency, it may be required to make an announcement to inform stakeholders of the filing.

5. **Criminal Record**: A criminal record is a document that lists an individual’s history of criminal convictions, including any charges, sentences, and other relevant legal information. It is used by law enforcement, employers, and other agencies to assess an individual’s background, and it can have significant consequences on a person’s ability to find employment, housing, or access certain services.

6. **Illegal and Irregular Record**: This could refer to entries or documents that pertain to activities that are not in accordance with the law (illegal) or that do not follow standard procedures or regulations (irregular). This might include fraudulent documents, evidence of corruption, or records of misconduct that are not part of formal legal proceedings but may be relevant in an investigation or audit.

If you are seeking specific information about an executed person or related legal documents, you would typically need to access official court records or legal databases. Access to such information might be restricted due to privacy laws or other legal regulations, especially if the information is about a private individual. In many jurisdictions, criminal records can be expunged or sealed, making them unavailable to the public.
