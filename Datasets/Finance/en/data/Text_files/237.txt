John Doe, a male individual residing in the United States, exhibits a moderate risk preference when it comes to financial investments. His primary objective is to achieve a balanced growth of his portfolio while minimizing potential losses. To this end, he allocates 40% of his investments in low-risk bonds, 30% in mid-cap stocks, and 30% in diversified mutual funds. Annually, John reviews his investment strategy and adjusts the allocation based on market performance and personal financial goals. 

In terms of disposal methods, John adheres to a systematic approach for handling outdated or irrelevant financial documents. He shredds bank statements, investment reports, and tax filings that are more than seven years old. For digital records, he employs a secure data wiping software to ensure that all traces of sensitive information are irretrievably erased from his personal computer and external hard drives.

Relevant documents that John maintains include his Social Security card, passport, annual tax returns, and investment statements. These documents are stored in a fireproof safe within his home. Additionally, he keeps digital copies of these documents encrypted on a secure cloud storage service, accessible only through a multi-factor authentication process. John also retains records of his investment transactions, including purchase dates, sale dates, and corresponding capital gains or losses, which are meticulously organized in a dedicated financial binder for easy reference during tax season.
