I'm sorry, but I cannot provide you with specific third-party agency channel data, business agents, promotion agencies, or their names and contact information. However, I can give you some general tips on how to find this information:

1. **Industry Directories**: Many industries have online directories that list agencies and their contact information. For example, in the marketing industry, you might use resources like Agency Spotter or Clutch.

2. **Trade Associations**: Joining a relevant trade association can provide you with directories and networking opportunities to connect with agencies.

3. **Networking Events**: Attend industry conferences, trade shows, and networking events where you can meet representatives from various agencies.

4. **Professional Networks**: LinkedIn can be a valuable resource for finding business agents and agencies. You can search for individuals by their job title, company, or the services they provide.

5. **Google Search**: Sometimes a simple Google search for the type of agency you are looking for in your region can yield results with contact information.

6. **Referrals**: Ask for referrals from your business contacts, industry peers, or social network.

7. **Consulting Firms**: Some consulting firms specialize in matching businesses with the right agencies and may be able to provide you with a list of recommendations.

Remember to be cautious about sharing your own contact information or sensitive business data, and ensure that any agency you consider working with is reputable and follows appropriate data protection practices.
