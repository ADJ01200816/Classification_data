An electronic document template file is a pre-designed file that serves as a starting point for creating various types of documents. It often includes standard formatting, placeholder text, and sometimes macros or automation features. The template is designed to make it easier for users to create documents that have a consistent look and feel, saving time and effort.

When referring to a "document definition document," this typically describes a file or a set of instructions that outlines the structure, content requirements, and formatting specifications for a particular type of document. Below are examples of what each might look like in a text format:
