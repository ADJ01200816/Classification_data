It sounds like you are inquiring about aspects of the currency, gold, and silver business, particularly related to inventory management and transfer, as well as the inventory amount in Renminbi (RMB).

1. **Currency, Gold, and Silver Business:**
   This business generally involves trading in currencies, gold, and silver. Activities can range from the physical trading of bullion to trading paper assets such as futures contracts or ETFs. Companies in this business often deal with:

   - Buying and selling gold, silver, and currencies.
   - Providing storage and secure vaulting services for precious metals.
   - Facilitating transactions for investors and institutions.
   - Hedging against market fluctuations.

2. **Currency Gold and Silver Inventory:**
   Inventory management is crucial for businesses dealing with precious metals and currencies. This involves:

   - Keeping track of the amount of gold, silver, and various currencies in stock.
   - Ensuring the security of the inventory, often using sophisticated storage facilities.
   - Regularly auditing the inventory to ensure the amounts recorded match the physical assets.
   - Managing the logistics of moving inventory, including insurance and compliance with regulations.

3. **Transfer of Gold, Silver, and Currencies:**
   Transfers of these assets can take place in several ways:

   - Physical transfer of gold and silver bullion from one location to another, which requires secure transportation and handling.
   - Electronic transfers of currency, which are common in the foreign exchange markets.
   - Book entry transfers of gold and silver ownership, which are common in the form of ownership certificates or through exchanges like the Shanghai Gold Exchange.

4. **RMB Inventory Amount:**
   When referring to the inventory amount in RMB, this could mean the value of the gold, silver, or currency inventory as measured in the Chinese currency. For instance:

   - If a company holds gold, the value of that gold in RMB would be the current market price of gold multiplied by the weight of the gold in grams or ounces.
   - The inventory amount in RMB is important for financial reporting, tax purposes, and for understanding the local currency value of the company's holdings.

In managing these activities, businesses must comply with the laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China, including:

- Regulatory oversight by the People's Bank of China for currency transactions.
- Compliance with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) for foreign exchange controls.
- Adhering to the rules set by the China Gold Association and other relevant bodies for gold and silver trading.
