The financial interbank market is a network of financial institutions that engage in various transactions and collaborations with one another. Here's an overview of the elements you've mentioned in the context of interbank relations:

1. **Financial Interbank Customers:**
   Financial institutions often act as customers to one another in the interbank market. They engage in transactions where one bank may provide services or products to another. For instance, smaller banks might use larger banks for various services, including clearing, settlement, liquidity management, and other banking services.

2. **Service and Cooperation Partners:**
   Banks collaborate with each other as service and cooperation partners to enhance their offerings, share resources, and manage risks. This cooperation can include joint ventures, syndicated lending, sharing of infrastructure, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Such partnerships can also extend to the development of new financial technologies and products.

3. **Interbank Fund Financing:**
   Interbank fund financing refers to the lending and borrowing of funds among banks. Banks with surplus funds lend to those in need of liquidity. This could be on an overnight basis or for longer terms. This market is crucial for the efficient allocation of liquidity within the banking system.

4. **Financial Interbank Business Data:**
   Business data in the interbank market includes a range of information such as interest rates, credit ratings, transaction volumes, and other relevant financial metrics. This data is essential for banks to manage their risk, set interest rates, and make strategic decisions. It's also of interest to regulators monitoring the stability of the financial system.

5. **Interbank Lending:**
   Interbank lending is the practice of banks lending funds to one another. This is typically done in the interbank market where the interest rates are determined by the supply and demand for funds. The rates can be a benchmark for other financial instruments and are an indicator of the liquidity and health of the banking system.

6. **Interbank Payment:**
   Interbank payments are transactions that occur between different banks on behalf of their customers. These payments can be for individual transfers, business transactions, or settlements of financial instruments. Efficient and secure interbank payment systems are vital for the smooth functioning of the financial system.

7. **Business Data Information:**
   In the context of interbank operations, business data information would encompass a wide range of data points that are relevant to the operations of the banks. This includes transaction volumes, average transaction sizes, frequency of transactions, credit risk profiles, compliance data, and other operational metrics. This information is critical for business planning, risk management, and regulatory reporting.

The interactions in the interbank market are facilitated by robust technological platforms, adherence to regulatory standards, and a high level of trust among participants. This market is watched closely by central banks, which sometimes intervene to ensure the stability of the financial system, typically by adjusting reserve requirements or engaging in open market operations.
