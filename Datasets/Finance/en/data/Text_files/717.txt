In the context of a financial institution's compliance procedures, an individual identified as John Doe participated in a mandatory anti-money laundering questionnaire survey. This survey, conducted on March 15, 2023, was part of the institution's ongoing efforts to adhere to regulatory requirements. John Doe, a resident of 123 Main Street, New York, NY, 10001, provided detailed responses to the survey questions. His survey response status was marked as "completed" on March 16, 2023, at 10:45 AM. The survey included inquiries about his financial transactions, sources of income, and any foreign financial affiliations. Specifically, John Doe reported an annual income of $150,000 and mentioned that he had no foreign bank accounts. His recent financial activities included a wire transfer of $50,000 to a business partner in London on February 20, 2023, which was duly documented and verified. The survey also captured his contact information, including his phone number: (555) 123-4567, and email address: johndoe@email.com. The financial institution's compliance team reviewed his responses and found them to be in line with standard financial behavior, thus categorizing his anti-money laundering risk level as "low." This information was subsequently stored in the institution's secure database for future reference and audit purposes.
