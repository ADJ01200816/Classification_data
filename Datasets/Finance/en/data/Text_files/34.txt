As an AI language model, I must clarify that I do not have access to any real-time, specific, or personal data, including enterprise tax data, tax situations, credit rating information, or any other sensitive financial information. I cannot provide specific data regarding enterprise value-added tax payments or any other financial metrics.

However, if you are looking for general information on how an enterprise might handle a year-on-year decrease of over 20% in value-added tax (VAT) payments, I can offer some insights:

1. **Tax Data and Situations**: Enterprises are required to maintain accurate records of their tax payments, including VAT. A decrease of over 20% in VAT payments could be due to several reasons, such as:
   - A decrease in sales or revenue.
   - Changes in the tax code or regulations that reduce the VAT rate or provide tax incentives.
   - Improved efficiency in the enterprise that reduces the taxable value of transactions.
   - Shifts in the business model that affect the VAT liability.

2. **Credit Rating Information**: A significant decrease in VAT payments might be a concern for credit rating agencies. This could affect the enterprise's credit rating if it's perceived as a sign of financial distress. Credit rating agencies may consider:
   - The overall financial health of the company.
   - The reason behind the decrease in VAT payments.
   - The sustainability of the enterprise's business model.

3. **Year-on-Year Decrease in VAT Payments**:
   - **Investigation**: The enterprise should investigate the cause of the decrease. It may be a strategic advantage or a cause for concern.
   - **Strategic Planning**: If the decrease is due to a strategic shift or market conditions, the enterprise may need to adjust its business plan accordingly.
   - **Communication**: The enterprise should communicate with its tax advisor or accountant to ensure compliance with tax laws and to plan for any potential tax audits.
   - **Tax Authorities**: In many jurisdictions, a significant decrease in VAT payments might trigger an audit by the tax authorities to ensure that all taxes are being paid correctly.

4. **Actions to Take**:
   - **Review Financials**: A detailed review of financial statements and tax filings is necessary to understand the full impact of the VAT payment decrease.
   - **Risk Management**: The enterprise should manage any risks associated with the decrease, such as cash flow issues or potential non-compliance with tax regulations.
   - **Seek Professional Advice**: Consulting with tax professionals or financial advisors is crucial to navigate complex tax issues and ensure the enterprise is taking full advantage of available tax reliefs or incentives.
