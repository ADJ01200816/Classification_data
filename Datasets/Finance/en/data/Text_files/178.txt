To calculate the values you've listed, you would typically have the following information:

1. **Overdue Date**: The date by which the payment was supposed to be made but wasn't.
2. **Overdue Amount**: The total amount that was supposed to be paid by the due date but remains unpaid.
3. **Overdue Days**: The number of days that have passed since the due date (overdue date) to the current date or to the date when the calculation is made.
4. **Penalty Interest Rate**: The interest rate that is charged as a penalty for late payment, usually expressed as an annual rate.
5. **Penalty Interest Amount**: The amount of penalty interest charged for the overdue period.
6. **Overdue Interest Amount**: This could refer to the total interest amount accrued due to the overdue payment, which might include penalty interest or other forms of interest.

Here is how you can calculate these values:

**Overdue Days**:
If you have the current date and the overdue date, you can calculate the number of overdue days by subtracting the overdue date from the current date.

```
Overdue Days = Current Date - Overdue Date
```

**Penalty Interest Amount**:
This can be calculated using the formula:

```
Penalty Interest Amount = Overdue Amount x (Penalty Interest Rate / 100) x (Overdue Days / Number of Days in a Year)
```

Where the "Number of Days in a Year" can be 365 for an exact day count or 360 if the interest is calculated based on a standard 360-day year, depending on the terms of the agreement.

**Overdue Interest Amount**:
This is sometimes used interchangeably with penalty interest, but if it refers to a different type of interest (e.g., regular interest plus penalty interest), the calculation would be:

```
Overdue Interest Amount = Overdue Amount x (Total Interest Rate / 100) x (Overdue Days / Number of Days in a Year)
```

Where "Total Interest Rate" would include any regular interest rate in addition to the penalty rate if applicable.

Note that the interest calculations can get more complex if compounding is involved, or if the terms of the agreement specify a different method of calculation. Be sure to check the terms and conditions associated with the payment agreement or loan for exact instructions on how to calculate interest and penalties.
