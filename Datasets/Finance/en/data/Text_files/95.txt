Guarantor, guarantee method, guarantee type, guarantee amount, and guarantee ratio are terms often used in financial transactions and agreements. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **Guarantor**: A guarantor is a person or entity that assumes responsibility for the payment of a debt or the fulfillment of an obligation if the original party fails to do so. By guaranteeing the debt or obligation, the guarantor provides assurance to the creditor that they will be compensated in case of default by the principal debtor.

2. **Guarantee Method**: The guarantee method refers to the specific way in which a guarantee is provided. This can include various forms such as:

    - **Personal Guarantee**: The guarantor personally commits to repaying the debt.
    - **Corporate Guarantee**: A company guarantees the debt on behalf of one of its employees or subsidiaries.
    - **Secured Guarantee**: The guarantee is backed by assets or collateral that can be seized if the debtor defaults.

3. **Guarantee Type**: This refers to the category of guarantee based on its legal structure and purpose. Types include:

    - **Performance Guarantee**: Ensures that the contractor will complete the work as specified.
    - **Payment Guarantee**: Ensures that the debtor will make the required payments.
    - **Advance Payment Guarantee**: Protects the advance payment made by the creditor.
    - **Bid Bond Guarantee**: Ensures that the bidder will proceed with the contract if awarded.

4. **Guarantee Amount**: This is the maximum sum of money for which the guarantor is liable in the event of default by the debtor. The guarantee amount is specified in the guarantee agreement and represents the limit of the guarantor's liability.

5. **Guarantee Ratio**: The guarantee ratio is the percentage of the total debt or obligation that the guarantor is willing to guarantee. For example, if the guarantee ratio is 50%, the guarantor is liable for half of the debt if the debtor defaults. This ratio can be used to limit the guarantor's exposure and share the risk among multiple guarantors.

Understanding these terms is crucial for parties involved in financial agreements to ensure that they are protected and aware of their rights and obligations.
