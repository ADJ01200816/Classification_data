In the realm of banking and online financial transactions, a series of terms relate to the security and functionality of payment systems. Below, I'll define the terms you've listed:

1. **Bank Card Magnetic Track**: This refers to the magnetic stripe on the back of a bank card that contains sensitive cardholder information, such as the card number, cardholder name, and expiration date. It's used for swipe transactions.

2. **Chip Equivalent Information**: This pertains to the data that would be stored on a chip card (also known as a smart card or EMV card). This chip contains encrypted information to enhance the security of transactions, serving the same purpose as the magnetic stripe but in a more secure manner.

3. **Card Verification Code (CVN and CVN2)**: The CVN or CVV (Card Verification Value) is a three- or four-digit number on a credit or debit card that adds an extra layer of security in online and over-the-phone transactions. CVN2 is a specific type of CVV code used by Visa.

4. **Card Validity Period**: This is the period during which a bank card is valid for use. It is commonly printed on the card as a month and year (e.g., 12/24 for December 2024).

5. **Bank Card Password**: A password that may be used to access certain features of a bank card, such as ATM withdrawals or for verification in some card-not-present transactions.

6. **Payment Password**: A secret code used by the cardholder to authorize payment transactions, particularly in online or digital transactions.

7. **Account**: A financial record that represents the funds and transactions of an individual or entity at a bank or financial institution.

8. **Payment Account**: An account specifically designated for making payments, which could be a checking account, credit card account, or other types of accounts used for executing payment transactions.

9. **Network Payment Business System**: A system that processes payment transactions across a network, which includes multiple financial institutions and merchants. This system facilitates the transfer of funds from a payer to a payee.

10. **Personal Financial Information Subject**: This term typically refers to the individual whose financial information is being processed or stored, such as in the case of a bank account holder or credit cardholder.

11. **Login User**: A term that refers to a person who accesses a system or service by providing a valid username and password.

12. **Securities Account**: An account opened with a financial intermediary, such as a brokerage firm, to hold securities like stocks, bonds, and other investments.

13. **Insurance Account**: An account that holds information related to an individual's insurance policy and transactions associated with it.

14. **Login Password**: A secret combination of characters used to prove identity and gain access to a secure system or service.

15. **Transaction Password**: A type of password used specifically for authorizing transactions, separate from the login password, which adds an additional layer of security.

16. **Query Password**: A password that may be used to access information or perform inquiries on an account without providing full access to make transactions or changes to the account.

All these elements are crucial components of the security infrastructure designed to protect sensitive financial information and ensure the integrity of financial transactions. It's important for individuals to safeguard this information to prevent unauthorized access and potential financial loss.
