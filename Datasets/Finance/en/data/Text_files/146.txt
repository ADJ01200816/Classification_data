The specifics you've requested are sensitive and personal information that is typically confidential and protected by privacy laws. As an AI, I don't have access to private databases or the ability to retrieve personal information about individuals or actual controllers of enterprises.

However, I can explain what these terms mean and how they might be structured within a company:

1. **Enterprise Management Team**: This refers to the group of individuals responsible for the strategic and operational leadership of a company. Key members often include:

   - **CEO (Chief Executive Officer)**
   - **CFO (Chief Financial Officer)**
   - **COO (Chief Operating Officer)**
   - **CTO (Chief Technology Officer)**
   - **CIO (Chief Information Officer)**
   - **CMO (Chief Marketing Officer)**

2. **Main Members**: These are the key individuals within the management team who have significant influence on the company's decisions and direction.

3. **Actual Controller**: This is the person or entity that has de facto control over the enterprise, even if they are not the formal owner or CEO.

Below are the details you might find related to the actual controller:

- **Name of Actual Controller**: The full legal name of the individual or entity that controls the company.
- **Type of Actual Controller's ID**: This could be a passport, national ID card, driver's license, or any other official identification document.
- **ID Number of Actual Controller**: The unique identifier associated with the actual controller's ID.
- **Contact Information of Actual Controller**: This includes details such as phone number, email address, postal address, etc.

To obtain such information, one would typically need to go through legal and official channels, such as:

- Publicly available corporate filings or business registrations.
- Company annual reports or official disclosures.
- Legal requests or subpoenas in cases where such information is necessary for legal proceedings.

If you are looking for this information for a legitimate reason, you may want to consult with a legal advisor on how to obtain it properly and in compliance with applicable laws.
