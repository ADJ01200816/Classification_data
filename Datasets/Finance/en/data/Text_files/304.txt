Cross-border business activities involve companies or individuals conducting commercial transactions across national borders. Such operations often require compliance with various regulations and obtaining specific permits or registration numbers in the countries where they operate. When it comes to the revocation of a business declaration number or the revocation of business acceptance date, it typically refers to the process by which a company's authorization to conduct business is withdrawn by the relevant regulatory authorities. Here's an explanation of both concepts:

1. **Revocation of Business Declaration Number:**
   A business declaration number, often in the form of a tax identification number, VAT number, or equivalent, is assigned to a company to identify it for tax and regulatory purposes within a country. The revocation of this number would imply that the company is no longer recognized as a legitimate business entity for tax or regulatory purposes within that country, which could happen due to several reasons, such as:

   - Non-compliance with tax obligations
   - Engaging in illegal activities
   - Failure to submit required documents or reports
   - Request for dissolution of the company

   The process for revocation usually involves a notification from the tax authority or the relevant business registrar, and it could have significant implications for the company, including the inability to conduct transactions legally within that country.

2. **Revocation of Business Acceptance Date:**
   The acceptance date of a business typically refers to the date on which a company's registration or application for doing business is officially recognized and accepted by the relevant authorities in a country. This date is important because it often marks the starting point from which the company is liable for taxes and other legal obligations.

   The revocation of the business acceptance date would imply that the initial recognition of the company is being withdrawn. This could lead to a situation where past transactions and operations of the company might be re-evaluated, and the company could face penalties or other enforcement actions. Reasons for revocation might include:

   - Discovery of fraudulent information in the business registration
   - Non-payment of registration fees or other mandatory charges
   - Violation of business registration terms and conditions

When either of these events occurs, the affected company must typically take immediate action to address the concerns that led to the revocation or seek legal advice on how to proceed. Companies involved in cross-border business need to be particularly vigilant as revocation can affect their ability to operate not just in the country where the number or acceptance date was revoked but potentially in other jurisdictions due to the interconnectedness of global trade and finance regulations.
