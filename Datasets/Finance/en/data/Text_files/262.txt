Non-bank payment institutions (NPIs) have become an integral part of the financial services ecosystem, facilitating payment transactions without being traditional banks. These institutions are typically subject to regulatory oversight, which includes off-site supervision to ensure compliance with regulations and stability of operations. Below are some aspects regarding the supervision and operation of non-bank payment institutions along with the review of business indicators:

### Off-Site Supervision of Non-Bank Payment Institutions:

**Off-site supervision** refers to the regulatory oversight conducted without physical presence at the NPI's location. This form of supervision includes:

- **Review of Business Indicators:** Regulatory authorities require NPIs to submit various reports and indicators of their business operations regularly.
- **Risk Assessment:** Analysis of the risk management systems in place at NPIs to gauge their effectiveness and adherence to the regulatory guidelines.
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Ensuring that NPIs are following relevant laws, rules, and regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) requirements.
- **Financial Soundness:** Examination of the financial health of the NPI, including its capital adequacy and liquidity position.

### Non-Bank Payment Institution Business Indicator Review Information:

When reviewing business indicators for NPIs, supervisors typically look at several key pieces of information:

- **Internet Payment Account Information:** Details about the accounts used for internet payment services, such as the number of accounts, the activity level, and the average account balances.
  
- **Number of Payments:** The total volume of payment transactions processed, which can be indicative of the scale of operations and customer engagement.
  
- **Payment Amount:** The total value of the payments processed, which provides insight into the financial flows and can be used to assess the economic impact and exposure of the NPI.

### Specific Indicators:

- **Account Activity:** This includes the frequency of transactions, the number of active users, and any unusual patterns that may suggest suspicious activity.
  
- **Growth Trends:** The rate at which the number of accounts and payment volumes are growing can indicate the market's acceptance and the NPI's performance.
  
- **Customer Complaints:** The number and nature of customer complaints can highlight potential issues with service quality or compliance.
  
- **Security Incidents:** Any breaches or attempts of unauthorized access to payment systems, which can affect the safety and soundness of operations.
  
- **Capital and Reserves:** The level of capital and reserves held by the NPI, ensuring that they have sufficient funds to manage operational risks and potential losses.

Regulators use this information to assess the health of NPIs, their risk exposure, and their compliance with the regulations. By monitoring these indicators over time, supervisors can detect early warning signs of potential issues and take corrective actions when necessary. This oversight is crucial for maintaining the integrity and stability of the payment systems and protecting the interests of consumers and the financial system at large.
