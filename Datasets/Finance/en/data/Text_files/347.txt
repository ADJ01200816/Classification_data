It seems like you're asking for the details of a cooperative unit's contact person. However, since I don't have specific information about a particular cooperative unit, I can't provide you with the exact details you're looking for.

If you're trying to fill out a form or need a template for how this information might be presented, here is a general format:

```
Cooperative Unit: [Name of Cooperative Unit]
Contact Person: [Full Name of Contact Person]
Phone Number: [Contact Person's Phone Number]
Email: [Contact Person's Email Address]
```

If you have the cooperative unit's information and need to find the contact details, you typically can find this information on the cooperative's official website, through an official directory, or by contacting the cooperative's main line and asking for the contact information of the relevant person. If you're seeking information about a specific cooperative unit, please provide its name, and I can try to give you general advice on how to find such details.
