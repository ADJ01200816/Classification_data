The credit card business involves the issuance of cards that allow consumers to make purchases and pay for them over time, often with the option to pay in installments. When a purchase is made on a credit card and the cardholder chooses to pay it back in installments, this is typically referred to as a "credit card installment plan" or "installment purchase."

Here's a breakdown of the terms you've mentioned:

1. **Installment Data**: This refers to the information related to the installment plan that a cardholder has chosen for a specific purchase. It includes details such as the total purchase amount, the number of installments, the amount due per installment, the interest rate (if any), and the due dates for each installment payment.

2. **Number of Installment Periods**: This is the total number of payments that the cardholder will make to fully repay the purchase amount. For instance, a purchase of $1,000 might be paid back over 6 installments if the cardholder chooses a 6-month installment plan. The number of periods can vary depending on the credit card issuer's policies and the terms of the specific installment offer.

3. **Installment Handling Fees**: These are fees charged by the credit card issuer or the merchant for the privilege of paying for a purchase over several installments. Installment handling fees can be a flat fee or a percentage of the total purchase amount and can vary based on factors like the length of the installment period and the cardholder's creditworthiness.

Credit card issuers may use installment plans to attract customers or encourage larger purchases, while also generating revenue from the interest or fees associated with these plans. Here are a few points about these fees:

- The fees can be upfront, meaning they are charged at the time the purchase is divided into installments, or they can be spread out over the installments themselves.
- Some installment plans may not charge any fees if paid according to the agreed schedule, but interest will be charged on the outstanding balance.
- The fees are in addition to any interest that might be charged if the cardholder does not pay the full balance by the due date each month.

It's important for consumers to understand the terms of an installment plan, including the number of installments and any fees, as these can significantly affect the total cost of a purchase over time.
