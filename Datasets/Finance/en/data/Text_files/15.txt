### Categorization of Relationship Data

When recording data, relationships can be categorized as follows:

  - Marital (e.g., spouse, ex-spouse)

For each category, you may record the following data:

Recording such data is often subject to privacy laws and regulations, which vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purpose of data collection.
