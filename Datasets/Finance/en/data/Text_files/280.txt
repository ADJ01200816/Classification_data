It seems you are referring to information that would typically be required when an institution, such as a business or an organization, is applying for some form of registration, accreditation, or recognition. Here's what each of the terms you've mentioned refers to:

1. **Business Number**: This is a unique identifier assigned to a business or organization for tax and other purposes. In Canada, for example, the Business Number (BN) is used for GST/HST, Payroll, and Import/Export accounts. The format usually includes a series of nine digits, followed by a check digit, and is commonly used for various government services related to businesses.

2. **Institution Application Date**: This refers to the date on which the institution formally submitted its application for whatever registration, accreditation, or recognition it is seeking. This date is significant as it may mark the beginning of the process and is often used to track the timeline of the application process.

When filling out an application for an institution, you would typically need to provide the following information:

- **Business Name**: The legal name of the institution or business.
- **Business Number**: The unique identifier for the business, if already assigned.
- **Institution Application Date**: The date when the application form is signed and submitted.
- **Contact Information**: Address, phone number, email, and contact person details.
- **Nature of Business**: A brief description of the institution's activities or the services it provides.
- **Other relevant information**: Depending on the nature of the application, other information such as the type of institution, ownership details, financial information, and compliance requirements might be needed.

For specific applications, there could be additional information required. It is important to ensure that all the details provided are accurate and complete to avoid delays in the application process.
