The loan business involves the lending of money to individuals or businesses with the agreement that the principal plus interest will be repaid over a specified period.

### Collection Cycle

The collection cycle typically involves the following stages:

1. **Pre-Delinquency:**
   - Reminders are sent before the payment due date to encourage on-time payments.

2. **Early Delinquency:**
   - Contact borrowers who are 1-30 days past due. The focus is generally on reminding them of the payment due and offering help if necessary.

3. **Late Delinquency:**
   - For borrowers who are 31-90 days past due, the approach becomes more assertive. Collection efforts intensify with more frequent communications.

4. **Severe Delinquency:**
   - At 91+ days past due, the lender may escalate the collection efforts, often transferring the account to a collection agency or initiating legal action.

5. **Charge-Off:**
   - If the debt remains unpaid, after a certain period, typically 120-180 days, the lender may charge off the loan as a loss for accounting purposes, although they may still attempt to collect or sell the debt to a third party.

6. **Post-Charge Off:**
   - Even after charge-off, the lender or a debt buyer may continue collection efforts or negotiate settlements with the borrower.

The collection cycle and methods may vary based on the type of loan, lender's policy, and local regulations. It's also important for lenders to maintain compliance with relevant laws and regulations, such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) in the United States, when collecting on debts.
