In the insurance underwriting process, the applicant's personal details were meticulously reviewed. The individual, identified as John Doe, was a 35-year-old male residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, IL, USA. His employment history indicated a stable position as a software engineer at Tech Innovations Inc., with an annual salary of $90,000. The risk investigation information revealed a clean driving record and no prior significant health issues, apart from a minor surgery in 2018 for a torn meniscus. The underwriting conclusion was favorable, stating that the applicant posed a low risk to the insurer. The underwriting opinion further recommended standard coverage with no additional exclusions. The fees associated with the policy amounted to $1,200 annually, with a monthly premium of $100. Discounts were applied due to the applicant's non-smoker status and participation in a wellness program, reducing the premium by 10%. Additionally, a loyalty reduction of 5% was granted as the applicant had been a client for over five years, bringing the final monthly premium to $85. The policy was set to commence on January 1, 2024, with all terms and conditions outlined in the official documentation provided to the applicant.
