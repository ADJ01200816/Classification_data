An inclusive financial system is one that ensures that all individuals and businesses, regardless of their income level, have access to financial products and services. To monitor the progress and impact of such systems, a set of inclusive financial indicators is often used. Below are some of the key indicators, their names, and the dates when they were activated or introduced, although it is important to note that the activation dates can be context-specific depending on the country or the institution that introduces them:

1. **Financial Inclusion Index (FII)** - This is a composite measure that captures the state of financial inclusion in a country. The activation date is context-specific, with different organizations or countries adopting their own FIIs at different times.

2. **Number of Bank Accounts per 1,000 Adults** - This is a basic indicator of access to financial services. No specific activation date exists as it has been a standard metric used over time.

3. **Mobile Money Usage** - The introduction of mobile money as an indicator would vary, but it became prominent after the launch of M-Pesa in Kenya in 2007, which significantly influenced the use of this metric.

4. **Use of Digital Financial Services** - As an indicator, this has been increasingly tracked since around 2010 when digital financial services started becoming more prevalent.

5. **借记卡和信用卡普及率** - This indicator tracks the number of debit and credit cards per capita. Activation dates vary, but the use of these metrics became more common in the 1990s and 2000s as card usage expanded.

6. **Microfinance Gross Loans** - This indicator tracks the total amount of microfinance loans provided. It became a key indicator following the success of the microfinance model in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

7. **Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Finance Penetration** - Indicators related to SME financing have been tracked more formally since around the mid-2000s when the importance of SMEs in economic development was widely acknowledged.

8. **Insurance Penetration Rate** - Tracking the percentage of the population with insurance policies. The activation of this indicator is not tied to a specific date but has been used as a metric for several decades.

9. **Credit Bureau Coverage** - The percentage of the adult population with a credit history covered by a credit bureau. This indicator has been tracked more closely since the late 1990s to early 2000s when credit bureaus started to become more widespread globally.

10. **Women’s Financial Inclusion** - Specific indicators related to women's financial inclusion, such as the gender gap in account ownership, have been tracked more closely since around 2011 when the Global Findex database was first launched by the World Bank.

The activation dates for these indicators are not universally fixed, as different countries and international organizations may have started tracking these at various times based on their priorities and the evolution of the financial sector. Moreover, the specific names and definitions of these indicators can also vary between different organizations such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and various national governments and central banks.
