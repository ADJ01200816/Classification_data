In the financial processing department, the procedure begins with the meticulous sorting of various denominations, ensuring each note is categorized accurately. This initial step is followed by a rigorous re-counting process to verify the accuracy of the sorted amounts, utilizing advanced counting machines for precision. Subsequently, any identified unfit currency undergoes a systematic destruction protocol, adhering to strict security protocols to prevent misuse. Additionally, the sorting of complete bundles of vouchers is conducted in an organized manner, ensuring each bundle is intact and correctly labeled. In cases where bundles are found to be damaged, a thorough re-counting procedure is implemented to ascertain the exact number of vouchers and their respective values, thereby maintaining the integrity of the financial records. Each stage of the process is meticulously documented, with detailed logs maintained for audit purposes. The entire operation is carried out in a controlled environment to ensure the highest standards of security and accuracy are maintained throughout.
