A safe-deposit box, also known as a safety deposit box, is a secure container that is rented out to individuals by banks or other financial institutions to store valuable possessions and important documents. These boxes are kept within a bank's vault or a separate secure facility and offer a higher level of protection against theft, damage, and loss when compared to home safes.

Safe-deposit boxes come in various sizes to accommodate different needs, such as storing jewelry, important papers like wills, property deeds, and insurance policies, collectibles, or other valuable items that one wishes to protect.

Here are some key points about safe-deposit boxes:

- **Access**: Typically, access to a safe-deposit box is gained through a dual-key system, where the bank holds one key and the renter holds the other. Both keys are required to open the box.

- **Privacy**: Safe-deposit boxes offer privacy, as only the renter (and those authorized by the renter) can access the contents of the box.

- **Insurance**: Items in a safe-deposit box are generally not insured by the bank. Renters should ensure their own insurance coverage for the contents of the box if desired.

- **Cost**: Renting a safe-deposit box usually involves an annual fee that varies depending on the size of the box and the location of the bank.

- **Rules and Regulations**: There are certain items that cannot be stored in a safe-deposit box, such as perishables, hazardous materials, and items that could cause damage to the box or other boxes.

- **Emergencies**: In the event of the renter's death, the bank will seal the box, and it may require a court order to open it.

Safe-deposit boxes are a practical option for those looking to secure their valuables, but it is important for individuals to understand the terms of rental and what is permitted and insured when using them.
