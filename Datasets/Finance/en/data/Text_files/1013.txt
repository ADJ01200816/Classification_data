ABC Financial Solutions, a specialized entity in the realm of financial asset management, recently executed a strategic maneuver involving non-performing assets. The transaction encompassed the acquisition and subsequent disposal of a portfolio valued at approximately $15 million. The process was formalized through a meticulously drafted debt transfer agreement, which delineated key temporal milestones: the benchmark date was set as March 1, 2023, the delivery date was scheduled for April 15, 2023, and the payment date was agreed upon as May 30, 2023.

The asset transferor, XYZ Holdings, a prominent player in the commercial lending sector, relinquished its rights to the assets in question. The asset buyer, DEF Investments, a seasoned firm with a robust track record in distressed asset management, assumed these rights. An exhaustive asset delivery list was appended to the agreement, detailing each asset's specifics, including but not limited to, loan amounts, collateral descriptions, and borrower profiles.

Warrant information was explicitly outlined, ensuring that DEF Investments was apprised of all existing warranties associated with the assets. A comprehensive defect disclosure was provided by XYZ Holdings, transparently enumerating any known issues or potential liabilities linked to the non-performing assets. Transition period arrangements were negotiated, allowing for a seamless transfer of asset management responsibilities over a 60-day period.

The agreement incorporated a meticulously crafted exemption clause, absolving both parties from certain liabilities under predefined conditions. The transfer subject matter contract meticulously documented the terms of the asset transfer, including interest rate information pertinent to the outstanding loans. Each debtor's profile was scrutinized, with particular attention to extension information, which detailed any prior modifications or extensions granted to the debtors.

The entire transaction was executed with a focus on compliance and due diligence, ensuring that all regulatory requirements were met and that both the asset transferor and asset buyer were fully informed of their respective obligations and entitlements. The interest rate information for the transferred assets ranged from 5% to 8% annually, reflecting the varied risk profiles of the debtors. Extension information revealed that approximately 30% of the loans had undergone modifications, with extensions ranging from 3 to 12 months. This detailed framework facilitated a transparent and efficient transfer of non-performing assets, aligning with the strategic objectives of both parties involved.
