In the context of a collaborative project, the cooperative unit identified as ABC Technologies appointed a specific individual as the primary point of contact. This individual, referred to by the name John Doe, was tasked with overseeing communication and coordination between the involved parties. For direct communication, John Doe provided his official phone number, which is +1 (555) 123-4567. Additionally, to facilitate written correspondence and document exchange, an email address was shared, specifically john.doe@abctechnologies.com. This information was meticulously recorded in the project's official documentation to ensure seamless and efficient communication channels were established and maintained throughout the duration of the collaboration.
