Anti-money laundering (AML) is a set of procedures, laws, and regulations designed to prevent the practice of generating income through illegal actions. Below are details regarding the concepts you've mentioned:

**Self-Investigation in Anti-Money Laundering:**

1. **Process**: Self-investigation refers to the process by which an institution reviews its own operations to ensure compliance with AML laws and to identify any potential money laundering activities. This can involve:
    - Internal audits
    - Transaction monitoring
    - Employee training and awareness programs
    - Review of customer due diligence and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes

**Assisting Other Institutions in Investigation:**

2. **Collaboration**: Institutions often collaborate with each other and with regulatory bodies in the investigation of AML cases. This assistance can include:
    - Sharing of information and intelligence
    - Joint investigations
    - Provision of expertise or resources
    - Coordination of actions to disrupt money laundering networks

**Anti-Money Laundering Cases:**

3. **Cases**: These are instances where individuals or entities are suspected of engaging in money laundering activities. These cases are typically complex and can involve multiple jurisdictions.

**Information in AML:**

4. **Importance of Information**: In AML efforts, information is crucial. It includes:
    - Customer data
    - Transaction records
    - Suspicious activity reports (SARs)
    - Intelligence from other financial institutions or law enforcement agencies

**Anti-Money Laundering Administrative Investigation Report:**

5. **Report**: This is a detailed document prepared after an investigation into potential AML violations within an institution. It typically includes:
    - Findings of the investigation
    - Evidence collected
    - Conclusions regarding compliance with AML regulations
    - Recommendations for corrective actions if necessary

**Anti-Money Laundering Administrative Investigation Notification Number:**

6. **Notification Number**: This is a unique identifier assigned to an AML administrative investigation notification. When an institution is under investigation, it may receive a notification from the regulatory body conducting the investigation. This number serves as a reference for all correspondence and documentation related to the investigation. It helps in:
    - Tracking the investigation process
    - Ensuring that all relevant parties have access to the necessary information
    - Maintaining a clear audit trail for compliance purposes

Institutions must maintain strict confidentiality regarding ongoing investigations and follow legal procedures to ensure that all actions are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
