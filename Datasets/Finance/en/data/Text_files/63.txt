To provide you with the specific details you've requested, I would need to know the exact name of the enterprise or additional identifying information, as these details pertain to specific companies and are not generally known or shared without context.

However, I can explain what each term refers to:

1. **Legal Representative**: This is the person designated to act on behalf of the company in legal matters and is often a senior executive or the owner of the company.

2. **Enterprise Name**: This is the official name of the business as registered with the appropriate government authorities.

7. **Economic Type**: This describes the form of ownership or the economic sector to which the company belongs, such as state-owned, private, collective, joint venture, etc.

8. **Personnel Size**: This indicates the number of employees that the company has.

If you are looking for this information for a specific enterprise, you would typically find it on the company's business license, registration documents, or by searching through the relevant business registration databases available in the country where the company is registered. In China, for example, you can search for such information through the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System.
