In the credit card business, several key terms define the operational and financial parameters of a credit card account. Here's what each of these terms generally refers to:

1. **Card Issuance Date:**
   - This is the date on which the credit card is physically manufactured and issued by the bank or financial institution. It's the point at which the card begins its journey to the cardholder. The card issuance date is important for tracking purposes within the bank and for the cardholder as it may indicate the start of any fees that might apply from the date of issuance.

2. **Activation Date:**
   - This is the date on which the credit card becomes operational and can be used for transactions. The activation date is usually after the card issuance date, once the card has been received by the cardholder. Cardholders are typically required to activate their card through a phone call, online portal, or by making a transaction at a point of sale. Until a card is activated, it cannot be used to make purchases or withdrawals.

3. **Credit Limit:**
   - This is the maximum amount of money that a cardholder can borrow on a credit card. The credit limit is determined by the issuer based on the cardholder's creditworthiness, which includes factors such as credit score, income, and credit history. Cardholders can make purchases up to their credit limit, but going over this limit can result in fees and a negative impact on the cardholder's credit score. The credit limit can be increased or decreased by the issuer over time based on the cardholder's financial behavior.

4. **Withdrawal Limit:**
   - Also known as a cash advance limit, this is the maximum amount of money a cardholder can withdraw from an ATM or over the counter at a bank using their credit card. The withdrawal limit is often lower than the overall credit limit on the card and may also come with higher interest rates and fees compared to standard purchases. Withdrawals made against the credit card are considered cash advances and do not have the same grace period as purchases; interest begins to accrue immediately.

Understanding these terms is crucial for both credit card issuers and cardholders, as they affect how the credit card is used, the terms of the credit extended, and the costs associated with the account.
