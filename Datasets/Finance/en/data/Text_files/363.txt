John Doe, a resident of the United States, applied for an extension on his mortgage payment due to unforeseen medical expenses. His current mortgage balance stands at $250,000, with a monthly payment of $1,500. The financial institution granted him a 60-day extension period, during which an additional interest rate of 2.5% was applied. This resulted in an extension amount of $3,750, bringing his total payment for the extended period to $4,250. The extension frequency was set to a one-time occurrence, specifically tailored to address the immediate financial strain caused by the medical emergency. Detailed records of the transaction, including the exact dates and the specific reason cited for the extension, were meticulously documented in the bank's system for compliance and auditing purposes. The borrower's financial history, including previous on-time payments and credit score of 720, were also taken into consideration during the approval process. The extension reason was explicitly stated as "unforeseen medical expenses," with accompanying medical bills totaling $15,000 submitted as evidence to support the request.
