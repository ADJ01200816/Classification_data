The information you've provided seems to be related to the concept of relending in the financial industry. Relending typically involves a financial institution or lender that loans funds it has received from various sources to borrowers. Below, I will clarify the terms you mentioned in the context of a relending business:

1. **Re Lending Business**: This is a practice where a financial institution, such as a bank or a microfinance institution, extends credit to borrowers using the funds it has received from deposits, borrowings, or other sources. The institution acts as an intermediary, channeling funds from lenders to borrowers.

2. **Information**: In the context of a re lending business, information is crucial. This includes data on the creditworthiness of borrowers, the terms of the loans, interest rates, collateral, and any other relevant details that inform lending decisions. Accurate and comprehensive information is necessary for risk assessment and regulatory compliance.

3. **Payment Settlement**: This refers to the process by which payments, including interest and principal, are exchanged between the borrower and the lender. In a relending scenario, the institution must ensure that it collects payments from borrowers on time and then settles payments to the original lenders or providers of funds.

4. **Business Information**: This term encompasses all the data and details about the relending business operations. It includes financial statements, borrower profiles, loan portfolios, interest rate policies, repayment schedules, and any other information necessary for the management and oversight of the business.

5. **Re Lending Purpose**: The purpose for which the funds are relended. This could vary; for example, relending might support small businesses, mortgages, student loans, or other economic activities. The purpose is an important factor in determining the risk profile of the loans and may influence the interest rates and terms offered.

6. **Re Lending Interest Rate**: This is the rate of interest charged by the financial institution on the loans it extends through relending. The interest rate is typically set based on the cost of funds for the institution, the risk associated with the loans, market conditions, and the regulatory environment. The interest rate must be competitive enough to attract borrowers while also ensuring profitability and covering the institution's costs and the interest payments due to the original lenders.

When engaging in relending, financial institutions must navigate the following considerations:

- Compliance with banking and financial regulations
- Credit risk management to ensure loans are repaid
- Interest rate risk management to account for changes in market conditions
- Liquidity risk management to ensure the institution can meet its payment obligations
- Ethical considerations, including responsible lending practices and avoiding predatory lending

In relending, the institution is effectively a middleman, and its success depends on its ability to manage these factors effectively.
