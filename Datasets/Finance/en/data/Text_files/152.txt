Understanding your request, here are the general concepts related to the tax situation, credit rating information, and value-added tax (VAT) payment for corporate taxpayers:

### Tax Situation for Corporate Taxpayers

The tax situation of a corporate taxpayer refers to the various aspects of its tax obligations and compliance, which include:

1. **Income Tax**: Corporations are subject to income tax on their taxable income, which is calculated based on their revenue minus allowable deductions and expenses.

2. **Taxable Events**: The tax situation includes when taxes are due, such as on the income earned, transactions conducted, or property owned.

3. **Tax Planning**: Corporations often engage in tax planning to minimize their tax liabilities legally.

4. **Tax Compliance**: This involves filing tax returns and other necessary documents on time and paying the taxes due.

5. **Audits and Adjustments**: Corporations may undergo tax audits, and adjustments may be made to their tax filings.

### Corporate Credit Rating Information

Credit rating information for corporations is crucial and can affect various aspects, including:

1. **Credit Ratings**: These are evaluations made by credit rating agencies that assess the creditworthiness of a corporation. This is often represented by letters (e.g., AAA, BBB).

2. **Factors Considered**: Credit ratings consider financial health, profitability, leverage, liquidity, and the overall economic environment.

3. **Impact**: A high credit rating can mean lower borrowing costs for corporations, while a low credit rating can result in higher interest rates and difficulty in obtaining loans.

4. **Regulatory Requirements**: Depending on the jurisdiction, certain corporate financial information, including credit rating, might need to be disclosed.

### Corporate Value-Added Tax (VAT) Payment Amount

VAT is a consumption tax applied to the value added to goods or services at each stage of production. Here’s what you need to know:

1. **VAT Calculation**: Corporations calculate VAT on their sales but can also reclaim VAT paid on inputs.

2. **Payment Amount**: The VAT payment amount is the difference between the VAT collected on sales and the VAT paid on purchases.

3. **Reporting and Payment**: Corporations must file regular VAT returns and pay the net amount of VAT due to the tax authorities.

4. **Thresholds**: Some jurisdictions have thresholds below which corporations are not required to register for VAT.

Below is how you might obtain specific information:

### Specific Information Obtainment

- **Tax Situation**: This information is typically obtained through the corporation’s financial statements, tax returns, and communication with tax authorities.
- **Credit Rating**: This can be found through credit rating agencies such as Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch Ratings. It might also be disclosed in the corporation’s financial reports.
- **VAT Payment Amount**: This information is usually available in the corporation’s VAT returns, which might be disclosed publicly depending on the jurisdiction, or it can be requested directly from the corporation if you have a legitimate reason.

Please note that specific and detailed information about a corporation's tax situation, credit rating, and VAT payments may be confidential and not readily available to the public without proper authorization.
