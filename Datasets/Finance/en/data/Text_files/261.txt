Non-bank payment institutions (NPIs) are entities that provide payment services without being traditional banks. They have become an essential part of the financial ecosystem, contributing to financial inclusion and innovation. Below are details regarding various aspects of non-bank payment institutions:

### Non On-Site Regulatory Business:

This refers to the regulatory framework that applies to NPIs, which often includes permissions to operate without the need for physical branches or "on-site" infrastructure that traditional banks require.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: NPIs must comply with regulations that may include anti-money laundering (AML) laws, know your customer (KYC) requirements, and data protection regulations.
- **Licensing**: Depending on the jurisdiction, NPIs may be required to obtain specific licenses to operate legally.

### Cost-Benefit Indicators for Non-Bank Payment Institutions:

These are metrics used to evaluate the financial performance and efficiency of NPIs.

- **Cost per Transaction**: This measures the average cost to the institution for each transaction processed.
- **Revenue per Transaction**: This reflects the average revenue generated for each transaction.
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: The expense associated with acquiring a new customer.
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: The total revenue an NPI can expect from a single customer over the lifetime of the relationship.
- **Profit Margin**: The difference between the revenue and the cost, divided by revenue.
- **Operational Efficiency**: The effectiveness of the operations in terms of costs.

### Audit Information:

Audit information for NPIs would include:

- **Financial Statements**: Balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.
- **Internal Controls**: Systems and processes in place to ensure the integrity of financial and accounting information.
- **Risk Management**: Policies and procedures that manage risks associated with financial reporting.
- **Compliance**: Verification that the NPI is adhering to relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards.

### Net Profit of Non-Bank Payment Institutions:

The net profit is calculated by subtracting total expenses from total revenue. For NPIs, this includes:

- **Total Revenue**: Sum of all revenue streams such as transaction fees, service charges, and interest if applicable.
- **Total Expenses**: Includes operating costs, employee salaries, regulatory compliance costs, technology investments, and any other overheads.

### Payment Business Revenue:

Revenue in the payment business can be derived from various sources:

- **Transaction Fees**: Fees charged for each transaction processed.
- **Subscription Services**: Reoccurring fees for premium services or access to payment platforms.
- **Value-Added Services**: Additional services such as currency conversion, payment guarantees, or fraud protection.
- **Interchange Fees**: Fees paid by the merchant's bank to the NPI for transactions made using payment cards.

Understanding these indicators and sources of revenue is crucial for NPIs to develop sustainable business models, maintain regulatory compliance, and ensure they remain competitive in the market. The financial success of an NPI is often a balancing act between managing costs and providing services that are attractive to customers while generating sufficient revenue.
