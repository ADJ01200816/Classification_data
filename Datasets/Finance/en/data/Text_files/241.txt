Counterfeit currency management is a critical aspect of maintaining the integrity of a country's monetary system. Below is an overview of the information related to counterfeit currency management, as well as sources and collection dates:

**Counterfeit Currency Management Information:**

- **Detection and Disposal:** Counterfeit currency management involves the detection of fake notes and their subsequent disposal. Law enforcement agencies, financial institutions, and cash handling businesses use various methods to detect counterfeit currency, including machine detection, UV light checks, and expert examination.

- **Reporting:** When counterfeit currency is detected, it is reported to the appropriate authorities, such as the police or the country's central bank.

- **Investigation:** Authorities investigate the source of the counterfeit currency to prevent further circulation and to prosecute those involved in its production and distribution.

- **Education:** Governments and financial institutions often conduct public awareness campaigns to educate the public on how to recognize genuine currency.

**Source of Counterfeit Currency Collection:**

- **Law Enforcement Raids:** Counterfeit currency is often collected during raids on illegal printing operations or from individuals suspected of circulating fake notes.

- **Financial Institutions:** Banks and other financial institutions are required to surrender any counterfeit currency they detect during their operations.

- **Public Reports:** Members of the public who receive counterfeit currency can report it to the authorities, leading to its collection.

- **International Collaboration:** Sometimes, counterfeit currency is seized through international police collaborations, such as Interpol, when it is detected crossing borders.

**Date of Counterfeit Currency Collection:**

The date of counterfeit currency collection varies and is not standardized. It depends on when the counterfeit currency is detected and reported. For example:

- If a bank finds a counterfeit note during a transaction, the collection date would be the date when the note is identified and reported.
- If law enforcement conducts a raid, the collection date would be the date of the raid.
- For public reports, the collection date would be the date when the individual brings the counterfeit currency to the attention of the authorities.

Since this information can be sensitive and part of ongoing investigations, specific dates and details are often not disclosed to the public unless official reports are released by the relevant authorities.
