When conducting a questionnaire survey among financial institutions with a focus on Anti-Money Laundering (AML), it's important to have an informative and concise title for your survey, as well as a clear way to categorize the response status. Below are examples for both the name of the survey and potential response status categories:

### Anti-Money Laundering Questionnaire Survey Name Examples:
1. **"AML Compliance Evaluation Survey"**
2. **"Anti-Money Laundering Practices Benchmarking Survey"**
3. **"Financial Institution AML Readiness Assessment Survey"**
4. **"AML Risk Management Perception Survey"**
5. **"Global AML Policy Implementation Survey Among Financial Institutions"**
6. **"Comprehensive AML Compliance Survey for the Financial Sector"**
