It seems like you're referring to an online verification service for resident ID cards. This type of service is often used to validate the identity of individuals by checking the information on their ID cards against official records. Below are some explanations of the terms you've mentioned:

1. Invalid Resident ID Card:
   An ID card that does not meet the necessary legal requirements or has been tampered with, expired, or revoked by the issuing authority. It cannot be used to prove one's identity or for official purposes.

2. Online Verification Service:
   A service provided by the government or authorized third-party agencies that allows individuals or organizations to verify the authenticity of a resident ID card online. This service typically requires the entry of certain personal information and a verification process.

3. Verification Serial Number:
   A unique code provided on the ID card that can be used in conjunction with the online verification service. This number helps to ensure that the ID card is genuine and links to the holder's identity in the government's database.

4. Verified Resident ID Card:
   An ID card that has successfully passed the online verification process. It confirms that the card is legitimate and the information on it matches the official records.

5. Validity Start Date:
   The date from which the ID card becomes valid. This is often mentioned on the ID card itself and indicates the period during which the ID card can be used for official purposes. The validity start date is important for the verification process, as it ensures that the ID card has not expired.

To use an online verification service, you would typically need to provide the following information:

- The verification serial number from the ID card.
- Personal information such as the ID card holder's full name, date of birth, or ID card number.
- The validity start date of the ID card.

Once you submit this information, the online service will check it against the government's database and confirm whether the ID card is valid and genuine. This process helps to prevent identity theft and ensures that the ID card is used by the authorized individual.
