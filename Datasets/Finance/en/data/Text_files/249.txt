An Invalid Resident ID Card refers to a government-issued identification document that is not recognized as legitimate due to various reasons such as expiration, damage, tampering, or because the data does not match official records. This can happen in many countries where residents are issued ID cards for various official purposes.

Below are explanations of the terms related to the context of an invalid resident ID card:

1. **Online Verification Service**:
   This is a service provided by the issuing authority or a third-party service that allows individuals or organizations to verify the authenticity of an ID card remotely. This service is especially useful for businesses that need to ensure their clients or customers provide valid identification for services or transactions.

2. **Verification Serial Number**:
   This is a unique number assigned to an ID card that can be used in conjunction with an online verification service. It typically serves as a pointer to the ID card's data in the issuing authority's database. When the verification service checks this serial number, it can confirm the validity of the ID card and the identity of its holder.

3. **Verified Resident ID Card**:
   This term refers to an ID card that has been successfully validated through an online verification service or other means. It confirms that the ID card is legitimate and the person presenting it is who they claim to be.

4. **Start Date of Validity Period**:
   This is the date from which the ID card becomes valid. All dates of validity are typically printed on the ID card itself. This start date indicates when the ID card holder is legally recognized as having the identification credentials provided by the card. The card remains valid until the end of the validity period, unless it is revoked or replaced earlier.

When an ID card is checked using an online verification service, the service confirms the validity of the card by checking the verification serial number against the issuing authority's database and ensuring the card is within its validity period, starting from the "start date of validity period" to the expiration date. If any discrepancies are found or if the card is outside its validity period, the ID card will be marked as invalid.
