The terms you've mentioned relate to the management of a country's reserves, including its gold and silver inventory, as well as currency and allocation matters. Here’s a breakdown of what each term might refer to, especially in the context of the Chinese Renminbi (RMB):

1. **Currency Gold and Silver Inventory**: This refers to the amount of gold and silver held by a country or an institution. For countries, this is typically part of their foreign exchange reserves and is held to ensure financial stability and liquidity.

2. **Allocation**: In the context of reserves, allocation refers to the distribution of assets within the reserves. This could mean how much of the reserves are held in gold, silver, foreign currencies, bonds, or other financial instruments. Allocation strategies are designed to balance risk and return.

3. **RMB Inventory Amount**: This could refer to the amount of Chinese Renminbi held by a financial institution or a foreign central bank as part of their currency reserves. As the RMB becomes more internationalized, more countries are holding it as part of their reserves.

Below is what you might be looking for:

**Specific Details:**

- **Gold and Silver Inventory**: Central banks do not typically disclose the exact amount of gold and silver they hold. However, for China, it is known that they have been increasing their gold reserves in recent years. The exact figures are published occasionally.

- **Allocation**: China's allocation strategy for its reserves is also not fully disclosed. However, it is known that they have a diversified portfolio that includes various assets to manage risk.

- **RMB Inventory Amount**: The amount of RMB held by foreign central banks as reserves is also not disclosed regularly. However, as the RMB becomes a more global currency, more central banks are likely to announce their holdings.

For specific numbers, you would need to look at official disclosures from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) or reports from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, here’s a general note:

- China's foreign exchange reserves are the largest in the world, and they include a significant amount of gold, but the exact amount of RMB in foreign reserves is not commonly disclosed. If you need the most recent and specific data, you would need to access the latest reports from the PBOC or relevant financial authorities.
