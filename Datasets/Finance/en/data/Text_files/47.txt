When discussing privacy and biometric data, it's important to note that any personal biometric sample data should be handled with strict security and privacy measures. However, for educational purposes, I can provide a general overview of what weak privacy biometric sample data might look like for each of the mentioned features. This is not actual data but a representation of what it could include.

**Face:**
- Weak privacy data might include basic feature values such as:
  - Distance between eyes
  - Nose width
  - Mouth shape
  - Jawline contour

Example (hypothetical):
```
Eye distance: 5.2 cm
Nose width: 2.1 cm
Mouth shape: Oval
Jawline contour: Square
```

**Voiceprint:**
- Weak privacy data might include frequency, pitch, and timber measurements.
  
Example (hypothetical):
```
Average frequency: 300 Hz
Pitch range: 50-300 Hz
Timber: Bright
```

**Gait:**
- Weak privacy data might include stride length, walking speed, and rhythm.

Example (hypothetical):
```
Stride length: 0.8 m
Walking speed: 1.2 m/s
Rhythm: Regular
```

**Ear Print:**
- Weak privacy data might include the shape of the ear, size, and distinctive features like the presence of a helix or antihelix.

Example (hypothetical):
```
Ear shape: Oval
Ear size: Medium
Helix present: Yes
Antihelix present: Yes
```

**Eye Print:**
- Weak privacy data might include iris pattern, pupil size, and sclera color.

Example (hypothetical):
```
Iris pattern: Radial
Pupil size: Medium
Sclera color: White
``

**Handwriting:**
- Weak privacy data might include slant, letter size, and pressure applied.

Example (hypothetical):
```
Slant: Right
Average letter size: 5 mm
Pressure: Moderate
```

**Important Notes:**
- The data above is highly simplified and not secure. Actual biometric data used for identity authentication is much more complex and sensitive.
- In real-world applications, biometric data is encrypted and stored in secure databases with strict access controls.
- Regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and others enforce strict rules on how personal biometric data must be handled to protect individual privacy and security. 

It's crucial that any handling of biometric data complies with relevant laws and regulations.
