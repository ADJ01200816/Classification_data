Non-bank payment institutions (NPIs) are entities that provide payment services without being traditional banks. They have become increasingly important in the financial industry due to their role in facilitating electronic and digital payments. Below are explanations of the terms you've mentioned in relation to non-bank payment institutions:

1. **Non on-site regulatory business**: This term likely refers to the regulatory framework under which non-bank payment institutions operate. In many jurisdictions, regulatory bodies require that certain businesses, including NPIs, adhere to specific operational and reporting standards. "Non on-site" may suggest that the regulatory oversight does not require physical, on-site inspections but may be conducted through off-site monitoring, such as reviewing submitted reports and audits.

2. **Non-bank payment institution asset-liability indicators**: These are financial metrics used to assess the financial health and stability of non-bank payment institutions. They include indicators such as the capital adequacy ratio, liquidity ratio, leverage ratio, and other measures that indicate how the institution's assets are funded by its liabilities and equity. These indicators are crucial for regulators to ensure that NPIs manage risks appropriately and maintain financial soundness.

3. **Audit information**: This refers to the information gathered and assessed during an audit of a non-bank payment institution. An audit could be conducted internally or by an external auditor to ensure that the financial statements of the NPI are accurate and comply with the relevant accounting standards and regulations. The audit information provides assurance to stakeholders, including customers, investors, and regulators, about the integrity of the NPI's financial reporting.

4. **Net fixed asset value**: This is a balance sheet item that represents the value of the NPI's fixed assets (such as property, plant, and equipment) minus any accumulated depreciation. Fixed assets are long-term assets that are not easily liquidated. The net fixed asset value indicates the net worth of the fixed assets after accounting for the wear and tear and aging of the assets.

5. **Paid-in capital amount**: This is the total amount of capital that has been contributed by the shareholders or investors of the non-bank payment institution. Paid-in capital typically includes the par value of the shares issued and any additional paid-in capital, which is the amount over the par value that investors are willing to pay for their shares. This capital contributes to the institution's equity and provides a cushion for the institution's creditors as it represents the shareholders' stake in the business.

Regulators closely monitor these aspects of non-bank payment institutions to ensure the safety and soundness of the payment system, protect consumers, and maintain the stability of the financial system as a whole.
