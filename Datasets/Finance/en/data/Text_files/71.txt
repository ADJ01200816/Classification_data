As an AI language model, I do not have access to any specific, real-time, or personal data regarding enterprise tax data, tax situations, or credit rating information of enterprise taxpayers. Moreover, information on tax payments, such as value-added tax (VAT) payments, is confidential and protected by law in many jurisdictions.

However, I can provide some general insights into the sorts of situations where an enterprise might experience a year-on-year decrease of over 20% in value-added tax payments:

1. **Economic Downturn**: A significant economic slowdown can lead to a reduction in business activities, which in turn can result in lower VAT payments.

2. **Changes in Consumption Patterns**: A shift in consumer preferences can affect certain industries more than others, which might lead to decreased sales and thus lower VAT remittances.

3. **Reduced Tax Rate**: Governments may reduce VAT rates to stimulate economic activity, which can result in lower VAT payments by enterprises.

4. **Increased Allowances or Deductions**: Changes in tax laws that increase the allowances or deductions available to enterprises can decrease the amount of VAT they need to pay.

5. **Changes in Business Structure**: An enterprise may restructure its business operations in a way that reduces its liability for VAT, such as by changing its supply chain or the way it invoices customers.

6. **Compliance Issues**: Sometimes, enterprises may be underreporting their taxes due to non-compliance or fraudulent activities. However, this would not be considered a legitimate reason for a decrease in VAT payments.

7. **COVID-19 Pandemic**: The pandemic has caused disruptions in business operations globally, leading to decreased sales and, consequently, a reduction in VAT payments.

8. **Regulatory Changes**: Changes in regulations, particularly those related to tax, can impact the tax situation of enterprises.

9. **Credit Rating Information**: Enterprises with lower credit ratings may be facing financial difficulties, which can be reflected in a reduction of their VAT payments. However, this information is typically confidential and only available to authorized financial institutions and credit rating agencies.

If you're interested in obtaining information about a specific enterprise's tax situation or credit rating, you would typically need to go through official legal channels or request the information from the enterprise directly, provided that you have a legitimate reason for doing so. In many countries, such information can also be accessed through government databases or regulatory filings if the company is publicly listed. However, accessing such data without proper authorization could be a breach of privacy laws or other regulations.
