Operating revenue, total profit, asset status, and liability status are key financial metrics used to assess the financial health and performance of a business. Here's a brief explanation of each term:

1. **Operating Revenue**: Also known as operating income or sales revenue, this is the total income that a company generates from its core business activities. In other words, it is the money a company makes from the sale of goods or services, minus any returns or discounts. It does not include income from investments, interest, or other non-operating activities. Operating revenue is a critical figure because it shows the sustainability of a company's business model and its ability to generate sales.

2. **Total Profit**: This refers to the overall profitability of a company after accounting for all revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. It is calculated by subtracting all the expenses (including operating and non-operating expenses) from the total revenue (including operating and non-operating revenue). Total profit is also known as net income or net profit and is a key indicator of how effectively a company manages its costs and operations to generate earnings.

3. **Asset Status**: This reflects the financial position of a company by showing what assets it owns. Assets are economic resources that are expected to provide future benefits. They can be tangible, such as cash, inventory, property, and equipment, or intangible, like patents, trademarks, or goodwill. The asset status typically includes the total value of the assets, how they're allocated, and any changes in the asset value over a certain period. This information is important as it can indicate the liquidity, solvency, and investment potential of a business.

4. **Liability Status**: This term refers to the obligations and debts that a company owes to external parties. Liabilities can be short-term (due within one year) or long-term (due after one year). They include loans, accounts payable, deferred revenue, and other forms of debt or obligations. The liability status provides insight into a company's financial leverage and its ability to meet its financial commitments. By comparing liabilities to assets, stakeholders can assess the company's solvency and financial risk.

Both the asset status and liability status are key components of a company's balance sheet, which provides a snapshot of the company's financial condition at a specific moment in time.
