   - The financial status of the individual at the time of the transaction (e.g., account balance, credit limit)
   - Any specific terms or conditions related to the transaction (e.g., payment plans, installments, or promotional offers)
   - The frequency of similar transactions (e.g., recurring payments or one-off transactions)
