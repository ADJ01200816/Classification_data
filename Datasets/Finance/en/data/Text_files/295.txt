Approval result, approval notice, administrative approval, and review opinion are terms commonly used in administrative procedures and decision-making processes. Hereâ€™s an explanation of each term:

1. **Approval Result**: This refers to the outcome of a decision-making process where an application, proposal, or request is evaluated. It indicates whether the application has been granted, denied, or requires further action. The approval result is the final decision made by the relevant authority or body.

2. **Approval Notice**: This is an official document or notification that informs the applicant of the approval result. It is typically issued by the approving authority and may contain details such as the terms of approval, any conditions that must be met, and instructions for the next steps.

3. **Administrative Approval**: This term refers to the process by which government agencies or other administrative bodies grant permission for certain activities to proceed. This can include permits, licenses, or other authorizations that are required by law or regulation. Administrative approval is often necessary for activities that affect public safety, health, or welfare.

4. **Review Opinion**: This is a document or statement that provides an evaluation of a proposal, plan, or project. It is usually prepared by a reviewer or a review committee and includes comments, suggestions, and recommendations. A review opinion may be sought before a final decision is made on an application, and it can influence the approval result.

Each of these terms plays a role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and due process in administrative procedures.
