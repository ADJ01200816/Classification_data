In the financial agreement dated March 15, 2023, between ABC Bank and XYZ Corporation, the role of the individual providing security for the loan was fulfilled by John Doe, a resident of 123 Maple Street, Springfield. The method employed for this assurance involved the pledging of real estate assets, specifically a commercial property located at 456 Elm Avenue, valued at $1.2 million. The type of guarantee stipulated in the contract was a fixed asset collateral, detailed in Clause 7, Section B. The amount secured through this arrangement was $800,000, which constituted 66.67% of the total loan amount of $1.2 million. This ratio was calculated based on the appraised value of the collateral and was documented in the financial statement appended as Annexure C. The terms further outlined that any default in repayment would result in the bank having the right to liquidate the pledged property to recover the outstanding debt.
