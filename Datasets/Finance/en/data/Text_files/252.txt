In a recent audit of the corporate network infrastructure, an identified weakness was discovered within the payment processing module, specifically related to an outdated encryption algorithm that could potentially be exploited. The current security protection configuration for this module includes a firewall rule set that permits traffic on ports 80 and 443, with an intrusion detection system (IDS) actively monitoring for suspicious activities. The policy information dictates that all access attempts must be logged and reviewed bi-weekly, with immediate alerts dispatched to the cybersecurity team in case of anomalies. The team has also compiled self-identified threat data, highlighting past incidents where similar vulnerabilities were exploited, resulting in unauthorized access to transaction records. Security alert information indicates that there have been three high-priority alerts in the past month, each related to unauthorized login attempts originating from IP addresses associated with known malicious actors. Furthermore, security event information reveals that on October 5th at 14:35 UTC, an unusual spike in data traffic was detected, which upon investigation, was traced back to a compromised employee device that had been used to initiate multiple unauthorized queries to the database server.
