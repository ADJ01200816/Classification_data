Credit management businesses and enterprise credit reporting agencies play crucial roles in the financial sector. They help lenders assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and manage the risks associated with lending. The total assets of these enterprises can vary greatly depending on the scale of their operations, market presence, and a variety of other factors.

For credit management businesses, total assets would include all the resources that the company controls, which could consist of the following:

1. Cash and cash equivalents
2. Accounts receivable (money owed to the business by clients)
3. Inventory (if applicable)
4. Investments in marketable securities
5. Property, plants, and equipment
6. Goodwill and intangible assets (like brand value or proprietary technology)
7. Any other assets the company may have, such as long-term investments or assets held for sale

As for enterprise credit reporting agencies, their total assets would similarly encompass:

1. Cash and cash equivalents
2. Receivables from customers (including fees for credit reports and other services)
3. Marketable securities and investments
4. Fixed assets such as office buildings, data centers, and technology infrastructure
5. Intellectual property, including databases, algorithms, and software used in generating credit reports
6. Any other assets acquired through mergers and acquisitions or other business operations

Unfortunately, I cannot provide specific numbers for total assets without detailed financial information about the particular companies in question. This information can often be found in the financial statements that public companies are required to publish, like annual reports and quarterly filings with regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States.

If you're interested in the total assets of a particular credit management business or credit reporting agency, you would need to look at their most recent financial disclosures. For private companies, this information may be harder to obtain unless they publicly release it or you have direct access to their financial records.
