To provide investor information data such as controlling shareholder name, registered capital, and paid-in capital, I would need to know the specific company you are interested in. This information can typically be found in a company's corporate filings, annual reports, or other disclosures, which are often publicly available for listed companies.

If you are looking for this information for a publicly traded company, you can usually find it:

1. In the company’s annual report (10-K) or quarterly reports (10-Q) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if the company is listed in the United States.
2. On the company’s official website under investor relations.
3. Through the regulatory bodies of other countries if the company is listed outside the United States.
4. On various financial information websites like Bloomberg, Reuters, or Yahoo Finance.

For private companies, this information may not be as readily available since they are not required to disclose the same level of detail as public companies. However, depending on the jurisdiction, you might still find it in business registries or other corporate filings.

If you provide the name of the company, I can guide you on where to find this information or, if possible, provide it directly from available public sources.
