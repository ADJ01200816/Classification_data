To provide you with specific financial consumer protection case information, including the case number and a brief of the case, I would need to know the particular case you're interested in. Financial consumer protection cases can vary widely, ranging from disputes over illegal banking practices, predatory lending, credit card fraud, or violations of consumer protection laws like the Truth in Lending Act or the Consumer Financial Protection Act in the United States.

If you have the name of the case or any specific details about it, please provide that information, and I can attempt to give you the information you're looking for. If the case is a matter of public record and has been widely reported on, I could potentially summarize it for you. However, please note that I cannot access private or sealed court documents or databases.

Once you provide the case details, I can create a brief summary similar to the following example structure:

**Case Number:** [Insert Case Number]
**Case Name:** [Insert Case Name]
**Court:** [Insert Court Name]

**Background:**
[Summarize the events or issues that led to the case, including the relevant parties.]

**Legal Issues:**
[Discuss the key legal issues or questions that were before the court.]

**Holding:**
[State the court's decision and any legal standards or principles that were applied.]

**Impact:**
[Explain the significance of the case and its impact on financial consumer protection law or practices.]

Please provide the details of the case you would like to know more about.
