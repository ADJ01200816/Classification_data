A financial asset management company specializes in managing a variety of financial assets, including handling non-performing assets (NPAs). Here's a breakdown of some key terms and concepts related to the operations of such a company, especially concerning the acquisition and disposal of non-performing assets:

1. **Non-Performing Assets (NPAs):** Assets, such as loans or advances, that are not generating income for the financial institution as the borrower has stopped making payments of interest or principal.

2. **Acquisition:** The process of purchasing assets, often non-performing, from the original lender (asset transferor) to manage or recover value from them.

3. **Disposal:** The sale or transfer of an asset by the current owner (asset transferor) to another party (asset buyer).

4. **Debt Transfer Agreement:** A contract that facilitates the transfer of the right to collect a debt from the debtor by the original creditor (asset transferor) to another party (asset buyer).

5. **Benchmark Date:** The specific date used as a reference point for valuing assets or determining terms in the contract, such as the valuation of the assets being transferred.

6. **Delivery Date:** The date on which the transfer of assets, as outlined in the asset delivery list, is physically or legally completed.

7. **Payment Date:** The date on which the payment for the transferred assets is due from the asset buyer to the asset transferor.

8. **Asset Transferor:** The entity that is transferring ownership or the right to collect on the assets to another party.

9. **Asset Buyer:** The entity that acquires the assets, potentially including the associated risks and rights to future cash flows.

10. **Asset Delivery List:** A detailed list of all the assets being transferred, including descriptions and relevant details.

11. **Warrant Information:** If applicable, details on warrants or other rights that may be attached to the assets being transferred.

12. **Defect Disclosure:** A disclosure requirement where the asset transferor must reveal any known defects or issues with the transferred assets.

13. **Transition Period Arrangement:** An agreement outlining how the transition of management or ownership of the assets will be handled during the initial period after the transfer.

14. **Exemption Clause:** A contractual clause that releases one party from liability under certain circumstances or for specified types of losses.

15. **Transfer Subject Matter Contract:** The contract that governs the specifics of the transfer, defining the scope of the transferred assets and the terms of the transfer.

16. **Interest Rate Information:** Details of the interest rates applicable to the debts or financial instruments included in the transferred assets.

17. **Debtor:** The individual or entity that owes the debt associated with the non-performing assets being transferred.

18. **Extension Information:** If applicable, details on any modifications to the terms of the debt, such as an extension of the repayment period.

Understanding these terms is crucial for parties involved in the acquisition and disposal of non-performing assets as they navigate complex transactions and agreements. The goal is typically to maximize recovery for the asset transferor and to identify opportunities for the asset buyer to profit from the subsequent management or resolution of the non-performing assets.
