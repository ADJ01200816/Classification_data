Risk management in various fields, including finance, project management, and operations, involves several key concepts and metrics. Let's break down the terms you've mentioned:

1. **Risk Identification:**
   The process of recognizing and naming potential risks that could affect a project, operation, or investment. This step involves understanding the environment in which risks arise and could include the use of historical data, expert judgment, or other analytical tools.

2. **Likelihood of Risk Occurrence:**
   This refers to the probability or chance that a risk will actually happen. It can often be estimated qualitatively (e.g., low, medium, high) or quantitatively (e.g., a 10% chance of occurrence).

3. **Risk Consequences:**
   The outcomes or impacts that would occur if the risk eventuates. This includes the potential damage to assets, operations, reputation, or financial standing. Consequences are often assessed in terms of their severity.

4. **Severity:**
   A measure of the intensity of the impact of a risk if it occurs. This is a component of the overall risk assessment and is used to understand how serious the consequences of a risk could be.

5. **Risk Level:**
   This is a composite of the likelihood of risk occurrence and the severity of its consequences. Risk level can be used to prioritize risks for further action. It is sometimes represented as a matrix with likelihood on one axis and severity on the other.

6. **Model:**
   In risk management, a model is a representation of the risk that uses statistical or mathematical techniques to forecast outcomes, assess risk levels, and inform decision-making. 

7. **Statistical Indicators:**
   Quantitative measures used to indicate the likelihood or impact of a risk. These could include standard deviation, variance, mean, median, or other statistical metrics relevant to the risk being analyzed.

8. **Customer's Single Debt:**
   This refers to the amount of money owed by a customer to an organization or financial institution. It's a specific risk factor that could impact the risk profile of a lender.

9. **Aggregated Risk Measurement:**
   The process of summing up or combining individual risk measures to understand the total risk exposure of an organization or portfolio. This could involve summing the potential financial losses, for example.

10. **Risk Weighted Asset Information:**
    In banking and finance, risk-weighted assets are a measure of the riskiness of a bank's assets, calculated by assigning a risk weight to each asset class and summing the products of the risk weight and the value of the assets. This is used in determining the minimum capital requirements.

11. **Risk Rating Score:**
    A numerical value or grade assigned to a risk that represents its overall level of risk, typically based on likelihood and severity. This score is used to categorize risks and prioritize them for management action or to inform decisions about risk mitigation or transfer.

These concepts are all integral to the practice of risk management, providing a structured approach to understanding and addressing the uncertainties that organizations face.
