The information you're seeking typically pertains to a specific company and is part of its corporate filings and public records. This data includes:

1. **Investor Information Data**: This can encompass a range of details about the investors in a company, including the size and type of investments, the types of securities held (such as common stock, preferred stock, or bonds), and any special rights or privileges that investors may have.

   - **For Publicly Traded Companies**: This information is often found in regulatory filings such as 10-K and 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States, or similar filings with equivalent regulatory bodies in other countries.

   - **For Privately Held Companies**: This information is generally not as readily available to the public, but may be disclosed in certain private placement memorandums, investor updates, or upon request to the company directly.

2. **Controlling Shareholder Name**: The controlling shareholder is the individual or entity that owns enough voting stock to control the company's decisions. This information can typically be found in:
   
   - Annual reports or equivalent documents.
   - Shareholder registers, which are often maintained by the company or a transfer agent.
   - Filings with the SEC or equivalent regulatory body for public companies.

3. **Registered Capital**: This is the total amount of capital that a company has legally registered with the appropriate government authority. It is the maximum amount of capital that the company is authorized to issue to shareholders.

   - This information is typically found in the companyâ€™s articles of incorporation or equivalent founding documents, which are usually on file with a government registrar or secretary of state.

4. **Paid-in Capital**: This refers to the amount of capital that shareholders have actually invested in the company. It can be further divided into different classes of stock and preferences.

   - This information can be found in the company's balance sheet under shareholders' equity, and specifically in the "Paid-in Capital" or "Capital Stock" section.
   - For public companies, this is also detailed in the financial statements included in their regular regulatory filings.

To obtain this information, you would need to access the company's specific filings with the regulatory body where the company is incorporated or registered. If the company is not publicly traded, access to this information might be more restricted, and you may need to make a direct request to the company or its legal representative. Additionally, some of this information might be available through business intelligence platforms, financial databases, or by engaging in due diligence for potential investment or business transactions.
