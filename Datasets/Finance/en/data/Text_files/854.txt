Asset type information: The enterprise's infrastructure includes servers, routers, and firewalls. Each server is categorized as either a database server, application server, or web server. Routers are classified based on their throughput capacity, such as 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and 40 Gbps. Firewalls are distinguished by their security features, including stateful inspection and intrusion prevention systems.

Asset value information: The database servers hold critical data, valued at $500,000 each, while application servers are valued at $150,000 each. Web servers are valued at $75,000 each. Routers with a 1 Gbps capacity are valued at $10,000, those with 10 Gbps at $25,000, and 40 Gbps routers at $50,000. Firewalls with advanced features are valued at $30,000 each.

Asset depreciation information: Database servers depreciate at an annual rate of 20%, application servers at 15%, and web servers at 10%. Routers depreciate at 5% annually, while firewalls depreciate at 8% per year. The current depreciation value for a 3-year-old database server is $320,000, for a 2-year-old application server is $127,500, and for a 1-year-old web server is $67,500.

Asset lifecycle information: The expected lifecycle of database servers is 5 years, application servers 4 years, and web servers 3 years. Routers have a lifecycle of 6 years, and firewalls have a lifecycle of 5 years. Currently, 20% of the database servers are in their final year of lifecycle, 30% of application servers are in their third year, and 50% of web servers are in their second year.

Topology relationship information: The network topology is structured with a core layer consisting of 40 Gbps routers, a distribution layer with 10 Gbps routers, and an access layer with 1 Gbps routers. Each database server is connected to the core layer, application servers to the distribution layer, and web servers to the access layer. Firewalls are placed at the perimeter, protecting the core and distribution layers.

System network security level list: The network security levels are categorized into four tiers. Tier 1 includes web servers with basic security measures, Tier 2 comprises application servers with moderate security protocols, Tier 3 involves database servers with advanced encryption and access controls, and Tier 4 covers core routers and firewalls with the highest security standards, including multi-factor authentication and real-time threat monitoring. Each tier is assigned specific security policies and compliance requirements, ensuring a layered defense mechanism.
