The Ministry of Finance, an administrative body overseeing economic policies, allocated a fiscal budget of $1.2 trillion for the upcoming fiscal year. This allocation is meticulously distributed across various sectors, including public education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. The Treasury Department, responsible for managing the nation's debt and government assets, reported that the current value of government-owned properties stands at $450 billion, while the total liabilities amount to $3 trillion. These liabilities encompass sovereign bonds, treasury bills, and external loans from international organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The Federal Reserve, a key financial institution, plays a pivotal role in monetary policy, influencing interest rates and controlling inflation. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service, tasked with tax collection and enforcement, collected $2.5 trillion in tax revenues last year, which constitutes the primary source of government funding. The Office of Management and Budget, an agency within the Executive Office, oversees the preparation of the federal budget and ensures that expenditures align with legislative appropriations. This intricate network of financial institutions and government entities collaborates to maintain fiscal stability and support the nation's economic objectives.
