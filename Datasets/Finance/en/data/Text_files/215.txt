It seems like you're listing various elements that are commonly associated with customer marketing and its management. Let's break down each term and understand their roles within a marketing framework:

1. **Customer Marketing**: This is a broad term that encompasses all activities aimed at promoting products or services to existing customers, with the goal of maintaining and enhancing the customer relationship, encouraging repeat business, and developing customer loyalty.

2. **Links**: In the context of marketing, links could refer to hyperlinks in digital marketing or connections between different marketing channels, touchpoints, or data points. These help in creating a cohesive marketing strategy.

   - **Processes**: The structured set of activities that need to be executed to achieve marketing objectives. This includes the workflow from lead generation to customer retention and beyond.

3. **Outcome Data**: The measurable results of marketing activities. This could be sales revenue, customer acquisition cost, customer lifetime value, conversion rates, etc.

4. **Marketing Activities**: Specific actions taken to promote a product or service, such as email campaigns, social media posts, content marketing, events, etc.

5. **Rule Models**: Pre-defined sets of guidelines or algorithms used to automate marketing decisions. For example, a rule model might dictate that a customer who has not made a purchase in the last six months receives a special offer.

6. **Marketing Lists**: Collections of contacts that are segmented based on various criteria for targeted marketing efforts. Examples include lists of leads, customers who have purchased a specific product, or subscribers to a newsletter.

7. **Task Events**: Individual actions or tasks that need to be completed within a marketing campaign, such as sending a follow-up email or scheduling a webinar.

8. **Assessment Indicators**: Metrics used to evaluate the performance of marketing efforts. These can include key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversion rates, click-through rates, or engagement levels.

9. **Marketing Contacts**: Individuals or organizations that are the target of marketing efforts. These are the people that marketing messages are sent to.

10. **Marketing Results**: The effects of marketing activities, which can be measured in terms of increased sales, customer engagement, or brand awareness.

11. **Marketing Evaluations**: The process of analyzing the effectiveness of marketing activities and campaigns to determine what works and what doesn't, and to inform future strategies.

12. **Assessment Profit Information**: Data that provides insights into the profitability of marketing initiatives, which includes not only the revenue generated but also the costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers.

In a marketing management context, all these elements are interconnected. For instance, rule models might be used to segment marketing lists, which in turn are used to execute marketing activities that are later assessed using outcome data and assessment indicators. This information is crucial for marketing evaluations and understanding the assessment profit information, which guides future marketing decisions. The ultimate goal is to optimize customer marketing efforts to achieve better results and maximize ROI.
