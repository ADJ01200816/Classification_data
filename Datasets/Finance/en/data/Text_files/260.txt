Non-bank payment institutions (NPIs) are entities that provide payment services without being traditional banks. They play a significant role in the financial ecosystem, and as such, they are subject to regulations. Below are the concepts related to your query:

1. **Non on-site regulatory business**: This refers to regulatory oversight activities that do not require physical presence at the NPI's premises. These activities can include remote monitoring, reporting, and other forms of supervision.

Here are the other terms explained:

2. **Risk Reserve Indicators**: These are metrics used to assess the financial health and risk management of NPIs. They provide insights into the level of funds set aside to cover potential losses.

3. **Audit Information**: This is the data and documentation that auditors review to ensure that an NPI is compliant with regulatory requirements and financial reporting standards. This can include financial statements, risk assessments, and internal control procedures.

Below are the specific financial metrics:

4. **Risk Reserve Provision Ratio**: This ratio is a financial metric that indicates the proportion of an NPI's funds that are set aside as a risk reserve. The formula for this ratio is:

    ```
    Risk Reserve Provision Ratio = (Amount of Risk Reserve Provision / Total Assets or Liabilities) * 100
    ```

    This ratio is important as it shows the percentage of the NPI's assets or liabilities that are reserved for potential losses.

5. **Amount of Risk Reserve Provision for the Current Period**: This is the actual amount of funds that the NPI has allocated during the current financial period to cover potential losses. This provision is typically based on the risk assessment of the institution's operations and is meant to ensure that the NPI can meet its financial obligations even in adverse conditions.

Here's how it's important:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Regulatory bodies often require NPIs to maintain a certain level of risk reserves to ensure financial stability and protect customers.
- **Financial Stability**: Adequate risk reserves can help NPIs absorb unexpected losses, reducing the risk of insolvency.
- **Investor Confidence**: A higher risk reserve provision ratio can signal to investors that an NPI is financially robust and capable of managing its risks.

Regulators may use these indicators and information to assess the soundness of NPIs and to take regulatory actions if necessary.
