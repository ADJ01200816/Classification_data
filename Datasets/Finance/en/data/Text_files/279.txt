A legal entity is an organization that has legal rights and obligations, such as a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or government agency. Legal entities are recognized by law and can engage in contracts, sue and be sued, own property, and perform other functions that an individual can, but on a broader scale.

The Global Legal Entity Identification Code (LEI) is a unique identifier for legal entities participating in financial transactions. It was developed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to enhance the transparency of financial markets and improve the tracking of financial transactions globally. The LEI is a 20-character alphanumeric code that consists of the following components:

1. A 4-character prefix assigned by the Global LEI System (GLEIS) according to an ISO standard.
2. A 2-character code representing the country where the legal entity is registered.
3. A series of alphanumeric characters that are unique to each legal entity.
4. A single check digit calculated using a formula designed to minimize errors in data entry.

An example of an LEI is: 549300uktrelz6vy8k93.

The Institution Verification Status refers to the confirmation process to verify the legitimacy and standing of a legal entity, typically in the context of regulatory compliance, anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, or know your customer (KYC) checks. This status can be confirmed through various means, such as:

1. Checking the LEI against a database maintained by the GLEIS.
2. Reviewing corporate documents, such as articles of incorporation or partnership agreements.
3. Confirming registration with the relevant regulatory bodies or government agencies in the jurisdiction where the entity is operating.
4. Using third-party services specialized in entity verification.

The verification status of an institution can be important for other institutions engaging in business with it, as it can affect the risk assessment and the legal and regulatory obligations associated with doing business with that entity.
