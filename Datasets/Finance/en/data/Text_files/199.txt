In the credit card business, the data related to withdrawals, often referred to as "purchases" or "charges," includes several key pieces of information. Below is an explanation of each of these terms:

1. **Withdrawal Data**: This typically refers to the details of a transaction when a cardholder uses their credit card to make a purchase or withdrawal. This can include:

    - **Withdrawal Date**: The date on which the transaction occurred. This is an important piece of information for record-keeping, billing cycles, and understanding the sequence of transactions on an account.

    - **Withdrawal Amount**: The dollar amount of the transaction. This is the amount that the cardholder has agreed to pay by using their credit card for a purchase or cash withdrawal.

The following additional pieces of information are also relevant:

2. **Remaining Credit Limit**: This is the amount of credit that is still available to the cardholder after a withdrawal (or series of withdrawals) has been made. The remaining credit limit is calculated by subtracting the total current balance from the card's overall credit limit.

Here's how these components might relate to one another in a credit card statement or transaction record:

- **Withdrawal Date**: 2023-03-15
- **Withdrawal Amount**: $100.00
- **Remaining Credit Limit**: If the credit card had a limit of $5,000 and the previous balance was $4,000, then after the withdrawal, the remaining credit limit would be $4,900 ($5,000 - $4,000 - $100).

It's important to note that when a withdrawal is made, the credit limit is not immediately reduced by the exact withdrawal amount, because transactions can take a few days to be processed and posted to the account. Moreover, if the cardholder has any pending transactions or authorizations, those could also temporarily reduce the available credit limit.

Credit card issuers provide this data to cardholders through monthly statements, and it can also be accessed through online banking or mobile apps. This data is critical for managing finances, ensuring that accounts are not overdrawn, and for detecting any fraudulent activity.
