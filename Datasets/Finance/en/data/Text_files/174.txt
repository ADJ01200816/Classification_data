When dealing with basic attribute information data for loans, several key pieces of information are typically recorded. Below is an explanation of each term you've listed, which are often found in loan documentation and databases:

1. **Loan Type**: This refers to the category of loan that has been extended to the borrower. Common types of loans include:
   - Personal loans
   - Mortgages (home loans)
   - Auto loans
   - Student loans
   - Business loans
   - Lines of credit

2. **Loan Purpose**: This describes the reason why the borrower has taken out the loan. The purpose may be required by the lender to ensure the funds are used appropriately. Examples include:
   - Purchase of a home or vehicle
   - Debt consolidation
   - Education expenses
   - Business expansion
   - Home improvements

3. **Loan Direction**: This term is less commonly used but could refer to the flow of the loan. In some contexts, it might mean whether the loan is incoming to the financial institution (as in a new loan application) or outgoing from the financial institution (as in funds being disbursed to a borrower). Another interpretation could be whether the loan is from a lender to a borrower ('outward' loan) or from a borrower to a lender ('inward' deposit, such as in a secured loan where the borrower provides the funds to be lent back to them).

4. **Loan Amount**: This is the total sum of money that is agreed to be lent to the borrower. This amount is typically specified at the start of the loan term and does not change, regardless of the loan balance over time.

5. **Loan Balance**: This represents the amount of money that is still owed to the lender by the borrower at a given point in time. The loan balance decreases as the borrower makes payments against the loan, which includes both principal and interest, depending on the repayment terms.

6. **Margin**: In the context of loans, margin usually refers to the collateral or the percentage of collateral value required by the lender as security for the loan. This term is more common in margin loans for investment purposes, where the borrower uses investment securities as collateral. The margin is the difference between the value of the collateral and the amount borrowed, and it serves as a buffer to protect the lender against potential losses.

In a financial institution's records, these attributes would be essential for managing the loan portfolio, risk assessment, compliance with lending regulations, and customer relationship management.
