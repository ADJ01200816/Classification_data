It seems like you are referring to a structured format for a type of document commonly used by financial institutions, which may be a financial document, report, letter, or notification. Below is an outline that details the specific components you've mentioned, along with a brief description of each. This format could be adapted for electronic processing procedures:

1. **Urgency Level**: Indicates the importance and time sensitivity of the document, e.g., routine, urgent, immediate action required.

2. **Issuing Authority Logo**: The logo of the organization or department that is issuing the document.

3. **Issuing Number**: A unique identifier for the document, often used for tracking and referencing purposes.

4. **Issuer**: The name and position of the individual responsible for issuing the document.

5. **Title**: The title of the document that succinctly describes its content or purpose.

6. **Main Sending Authority**: The department or division within the financial institution that is the primary sender of the document.

7. **Main Text**: The body of the document containing the key information, message, or request being conveyed.

8. **Attachment Description**: If there are attachments, a brief description of each attachment to help the recipient understand the content without opening them.

9. **Issuing Authority Signature**: The signature of the authorized individual from the issuing authority, indicating approval or authorization.

10. **Writing Date**: The date when the document was written or prepared.

11. **Seal**: An official seal or stamp that validates the document as authentic and authorized by the issuing authority.

12. **Notes**: Additional comments or instructions that may be important for the recipient to consider.

13. **Attachments**: Any supplementary documents or files that are included with the main document.

14. **Copy to Authority**: A list of other departments, individuals, or entities to whom copies of the document are being sent for information or action.

15. **Issuing Authority**: The full name and contact information of the department or entity issuing the document.

16. **Issuing Date**: The date when the document is officially released or sent.

When processing such documents in an electronic format, the following procedures may be implemented:

- **Secure Document Handling**: Ensuring the document is handled and transmitted securely to maintain confidentiality.
- **Document Formatting**: Converting the document to a standard electronic format (e.g., PDF) that preserves the integrity of the content, including the layout and the visual elements like logos and seals.
- **Electronic Signatures**: If the document is electronic, an electronic signature might be used in place of a physical signature, with proper protocols to ensure its authenticity.
- **Encryption**: Encrypting sensitive documents to protect them during transmission and while they are stored.
- **Tracking and Archiving**: Implementing systems to track the document once issued, as well as archiving it for future reference according to the institution's record-keeping guidelines.
- **Access Control**: Ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to the document and its attachments.

Each of these components and procedures may need to comply with specific legal and regulatory requirements, as well as with the internal policies of the financial institution.
