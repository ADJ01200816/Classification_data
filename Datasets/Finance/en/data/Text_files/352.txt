Financial institutions, such as banks and investment firms, operate with a focus on balancing profit, risk, capital, and liquidity. These elements are critical in determining the health and stability of these institutions. Below are explanations of these concepts along with related indicators, and potential target values or ranges, though it's important to note that these targets can vary significantly depending on the specific institution, regulatory requirements, industry standards, and economic conditions.

1. **Profit**:
   - Indicators: Net income, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), net interest margin (NIM).
   - Target Values/Range: For ROA, 1-1.5% might be considered good. For ROE, a target range could be between 10-15%. Net interest margin varies by the type of bank and current interest rate environment, but generally, a range of 2.5-4% could be expected.

2. **Risk**:
   - Indicators: Non-performing loans ratio (NPL), loan loss reserves, capital adequacy ratio (CAR), leverage ratio.
   - Target Values/Range: NPL ratios below 2-3% are generally viewed favorably. Loan loss reserves are usually a percentage of total loans (e.g., 1-2%). The minimum CAR, as per Basel III, is 8%, but most banks aim for higher, often between 10-12%. The leverage ratio under Basel III should be above 3%.

3. **Capital**:
   - Indicators: Tier 1 capital ratio, Total capital ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio.
   - Target Values/Range: Under Basel III, the minimum requirement for CET1 is 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, but banks typically maintain a ratio between 7-10%. For the Tier 1 capital ratio, the target is usually above 6%, and for the Total capital ratio, above 8%.

4. **Liquidity**:
   - Indicators: Current ratio, quick ratio, loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR), liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), net stable funding ratio (NSFR).
   - Target Values/Range: A current ratio of 1 or higher is often seen as satisfactory. The quick ratio, which excludes inventory, might have a target above 1 as well. The LDR ideally would be below 100%, with a target range of 70-90%. The LCR should be above 100%, as per Basel III requirements, and the NSFR should also be above 100%.

It's important to note that these targets can change during different economic cycles and as regulations evolve. Moreover, the specific context of a financial institution, such as its size, business model, risk appetite, and the regulatory environment it operates in, will significantly affect what target values or ranges are appropriate. 

Financial institutions must also adhere to the guidelines and regulations set by their respective supervisory authorities, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, the European Central Bank in the Eurozone, and other bodies in different jurisdictions, which can impact target values.
