You seem to be interested in gathering detailed information about a company, which is typically done for various reasons such as due diligence, market research, or regulatory compliance. In many countries, including China, this information can be obtained through official government portals or registers where company information is made publicly available. Here’s a breakdown of the types of information you might be looking for and where you might find it, especially in the context of a market supervision department in China:

1. **Enterprise License Information**: This includes the business license number and details regarding the legality of the enterprise’s operations.
   - In China, this information can be found through the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System (NECIPS) or the local Administration for Market Regulation (AMR).

2. **Registration Date**: The date when the enterprise was officially registered.
   - Also available in NECIPS or the local AMR, which maintains the company registration records.

3. **Enterprise Type**: The legal structure of the company, such as limited liability company, joint-stock limited company, etc.
   - This is specified during the registration process and can be retrieved from the same sources as above.

4. **Shareholders**: Information about the individuals or entities that own shares in the company.
   - Shareholder information can be found in the company’s annual reports or through the NECIPS, but note that details about individual shareholders may be protected from public view if they are not also listed as legal representatives or main management personnel.

5. **Investor Information**: Details about entities that have invested in the company.
   - This information might be detailed in the company’s equity investment records, which are also available through the NECIPS or other investment transparency platforms.

6. **Main Management Personnel Information**: This includes details such as the legal representative, directors, and senior management.
   - This information is part of the company registration and can be found in the same places as the enterprise license information.

7. **External Investment of the Enterprise**: Information about investments made by the enterprise in other companies.
   - This information might be found in the company’s investment disclosures or through their annual reports. For public companies, this information is often more transparent and available through securities regulatory commissions.

In China, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) and its local branches are responsible for market supervision. They oversee the following:

- Market秩序 (Market Order)
- Company注册 (Company Registration)
- 反垄断 (Antitrust)
- 保护消费者权益 (Consumer Rights Protection)
- 产品质量监督 (Product Quality Supervision)
- 商标注册 (Trademark Registration)

To access the information you need, you can:

- Visit the official websites of the SAMR or local AMR offices.
- Use the NECIPS online system.
- Contact the relevant government department directly and request the information, which may involve a formal application process.

Please note that while much of this information is publicly available, access to some sensitive or detailed information might be restricted, and proper procedures must be followed to obtain it. Legal advice or assistance might be required to ensure compliance with local regulations.
