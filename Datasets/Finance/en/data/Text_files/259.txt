Non-bank payment institutions (NPIs) are entities that provide payment services without being licensed as banks. These institutions have become an essential part of the financial ecosystem, facilitating transactions and providing payment solutions to individuals and businesses. Regarding reserve indicators, the number of reserve custody accounts, and the ending balance of these accounts, these metrics are typically more relevant to traditional banks and central banking systems. However, some NPIs may also be subject to certain regulatory requirements that involve maintaining reserves.

Here is a review of the information on these topics:

1. **Reserve Indicators**: These are metrics used to assess the liquidity and stability of financial institutions. For NPIs, reserve indicators might include the following:
   - **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)**: Measures the NPI's ability to cover its short-term liquidity needs.
   - **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)**: Assesses the extent to which an NPI can fund its long-term assets with stable sources of funding.
   - **Minimum Capital Requirements**: Although not reserves per se, NPIs must maintain a certain level of capital to ensure they can absorb losses.

2. **Number of Reserve Custody Accounts**: NPIs that are required to hold reserves may do so in special accounts. The number of these accounts would depend on several factors:
   - Regulatory requirements: Some jurisdictions may require NPIs to hold reserves and open custody accounts to deposit these reserves.
   - Business operations: Larger NPIs with multiple licenses or operating in different jurisdictions may have more accounts.
   - Account structure: Some NPIs may prefer to have multiple accounts for different purposes or currencies.

3. **Ending Balance of Reserve Custody Accounts**: This is the amount of funds that the NPI holds in its reserve custody accounts at the end of a reporting period. The balance would be influenced by:
   - **Transaction Volumes**: The higher the transaction volumes, the more reserves might be required.
   - **Regulatory Requirements**: Minimum reserve requirements can dictate the balance.
   - **Financial Health**: An institution may hold additional reserves as a buffer to demonstrate financial strength.

For specific data related to the number of reserve custody accounts and the ending balance of these accounts for NPIs, you would typically need to access regulatory filings or financial reports that these institutions are required to publish. In many countries, this information might be available from the relevant financial regulator or supervisor.

It is important to note that the regulatory framework applicable to NPIs varies significantly across jurisdictions. Therefore, the information regarding reserve indicators, the number of reserve custody accounts, and their ending balances will depend on the specific regulatory context in which the NPI operates.
