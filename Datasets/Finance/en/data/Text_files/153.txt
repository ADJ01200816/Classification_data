To provide you with specific information such as enterprise license information, registration date, enterprise type, details about shareholders, contributors, main management personnel, and external investments, I would need to have access to specific databases that store such company information. Typically, these databases are maintained by government registrars, commercial data providers, or financial regulatory bodies.

As an AI, I do not have direct access to external databases, and even if I did, sharing sensitive business information publicly would be a breach of privacy and often subject to legal restrictions. However, I can guide you on how to obtain such information:

1. **Enterprise License Information & Registration Date**:
   - This information is usually available from the government agency responsible for business registration in the country where the enterprise operates. For instance, in the United States, you can look up this information via the Secretary of State in the state where the business is registered.

2. **Enterprise Type**:
   - The legal structure of a business, such as corporation, partnership, or limited liability company (LLC), is also typically recorded at the time of registration and can be found in the same registries.

3. **Shareholders & Contributors Information**:
   - Shareholder information might be available in the company's public filings if it is a publicly traded company. For private companies, this information might be harder to obtain and is not always publicly accessible.
   - Information about contributors (which could be interpreted as investors or donors) is generally private for private companies unless disclosed in specific regulatory filings or reports.

4. **Main Management Personnel Information**:
   - Information about key company officials, such as directors or officers, is typically recorded with the company's registration and may be available through public records.

5. **External Investment of the Enterprise**:
   - Details about external investments may be found in financial statements, press releases, or regulatory filings if the company is publicly listed. For private companies, this information is usually not disclosed to the public unless the company chooses to release it.

To access such information, you can:

- Search the business registries of the country and state in which the company is registered.
- Look at the company's own official website and public disclosures.
- Use commercial databases like Bloomberg, Hoovers, or LexisNexis, which aggregate such information from various public sources.
- Consult with legal or financial professionals who have the expertise to access and interpret such information.

Please remember that access to some of this information may require legal authority or a legitimate reason, and the sharing of sensitive business information should always respect privacy laws and regulations.
