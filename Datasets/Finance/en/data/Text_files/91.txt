2. **Current Account (or Checking Account)**: Intended for daily transactions with no interest or minimal interest. Often used by businesses and individuals for frequent money transfers.
3. **Fixed Deposit Account (or Time Deposit)**: A deposit account with a fixed term and a fixed interest rate. Money is locked in for the term of the deposit, and early withdrawal may incur penalties.

5. **Call Deposit Account**: Offers higher interest rates than a savings account but requires a higher minimum balance. Withdrawals may have restrictions.
6. **Bearer Deposit Account**: A type of deposit where the holder of the deposit receipt can claim the funds, making it transferable by delivery.
7. **Online Savings Account**: A savings account that is managed online, typically offering higher interest rates due to lower overhead costs for the bank.

### Term Types:

Term types refer to the length of time for which the deposit is made and the conditions that apply:

1. **Short-Term Deposits**: Typically range from a few days to a year. They are suitable for customers looking to park funds temporarily.
2. **Medium-Term Deposits**: Usually range from one to five years, offering a slightly higher interest rate than short-term deposits.
3. **Long-Term Deposits**: Can range from five to ten years or more, often offering the highest interest rates among term deposits.
4. **Flexible Term Deposits**: Allow customers to choose a term that suits them, with the option to withdraw funds before maturity under certain conditions.

Understanding these attributes and types is crucial for customers and financial institutions to make informed decisions about managing cash reserves and providing competitive banking services.
