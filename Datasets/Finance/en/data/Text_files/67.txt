To provide you with the financial information data such as operating income, total profit, asset status, and liability status of a unit (which could be a company, a department, or any other type of business entity), I would need specific details about that unit. Since you haven't provided the name of the unit or any other identifying information, I'm unable to retrieve or calculate such data.

If you have a specific company or unit in mind, please provide its name, and if possible, the year or period for which you want this financial information. If the data is publicly available (for instance, for publicly traded companies), I can guide you on where to find this information, typically in their financial statements, which include:

1. **Income Statement**: This includes the operating income (also known as operating profit or operating earnings), which is the profit from the core business operations before interest and taxes, and total profit (or net income), which is the final profit after all expenses, including taxes and interest, have been paid.

2. **Balance Sheet**: This provides a snapshot of the asset status, showing what the company owns, and the liability status, showing what the company owes at a given point in time.

For publicly traded companies, these statements are usually available in the 10-K and 10-Q forms filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States or equivalent filings in other jurisdictions. Private companies may not disclose their financials publicly, but they may still be required to provide such information to investors, creditors, or regulatory agencies.
