It seems you're referring to various components of a geographic address or location data. These terms are defined as follows:

- **Country**: The largest political division of territory within which a government operates. Countries are typically defined by geographical boundaries and are recognized by international treaty or by a larger political body such as the United Nations.

- **City**: A large human settlement that is larger than a town but smaller than a metropolis. Typically, cities have a high population density and are centers for commerce, industry, and services.

- **Region**: A large area of land that is divided by natural or political boundaries. In some cases, it can refer to an administrative division within a country (like states or provinces) or a larger area that encompasses multiple countries or states with similar characteristics.

- **Street**: A public thoroughfare in a built environment that typically has defined boundaries and is used for vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Streets are usually lined with buildings and are part of a larger network of roads and pathways.

- **Longitude and Latitude**: These are geographic coordinate systems that define the precise location of a point on the Earth's surface. 
   - **Longitude** refers to the east-west position of a point and is measured in degrees ranging from 0° at the Prime Meridian to 180° east or west, depending on the location.
   - **Latitude** refers to the north-south position and is measured in degrees ranging from 0° at the equator to 90° at the poles, either north or south.

- **Location**: The specific place or position of something, often described by its geographic coordinates or address, which includes country, city, region, street, and possibly the longitude and latitude.

- **Current Location**: This term refers to the real-time geographic position of a person or object. It can be determined using GPS (Global Positioning System) or other location-detection technologies.

When discussing current location, you might refer to the combination of all these elements to give a comprehensive description of where you are or where a device or person is positioned at that moment. For example, if you were to pinpoint your current location, it might be described as "123 Main Street, Anytown, Anystate, Country, 12345, Latitude: 40.7128° N, Longitude: -74.0060° W". This would give a detailed and precise description of the location.
