Advance payment in a loan business context refers to the initial sum of money paid by a borrower to a lender before receiving the full loan amount. This payment can serve various purposes, such as demonstrating the borrower's commitment to repaying the loan, reducing the lender's risk, or covering some of the administrative costs associated with processing the loan. Below are the aspects associated with advance payments:

**Type of Advance Payment:**

1. **Down Payment:** A percentage of the total loan amount that is due at the time the loan is granted. This is common in mortgage and car loans.
2. **Commitment Fee:** An upfront fee charged by a lender for the commitment to provide a loan in the future.
3. **Earnest Money:** A deposit showing good faith and ensuring that the borrower is serious about securing the loan.
4. **Security Deposit:** An advance payment that serves as collateral for the loan, which can be forfeited in the event of default.

**Amount of Advance Payment:**

The amount of the advance payment can vary depending on the type of loan, the lender's requirements, and the creditworthiness of the borrower. For instance, a down payment on a house might be anywhere from 3% to 20% of the total loan amount, depending on the mortgage program.

**Date of Advance Payment:**

The date of the advance payment is typically set at the time the loan agreement is reached. It can be the same day the loan application is approved, or it may be set for a future date, aligning with the beginning of the loan period or the date of the actual disbursement of the loan funds.

**Interest Rate of Advance Payment:**

The interest rate on an advance payment is not usually a separate rate from the overall interest rate of the loan. However, when discussing interest in relation to an advance payment, it's important to note the following:

- If the advance payment is a fee (like a commitment fee), it may or may not be subject to interest.
- If the advance payment is part of the loan amount itself (like a down payment on a mortgage), the interest calculations would typically start on the date the full loan amount is disbursed, not when the advance payment is made.
- If the loan agreement specifies that the advance payment will earn interest (which is less common), the interest rate for that portion would be outlined in the loan agreement.

In most conventional loan scenarios, the interest rate applicable to the advance payment would be the same as the interest rate for the loan itself, and interest would only begin to accrue once the loan has been fully disbursed and the advance payment has been applied to the loan balance.
