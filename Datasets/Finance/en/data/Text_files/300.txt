The payment amount for settlement, clearing, banking, and cross-border clearing can vary significantly depending on the context, the transaction size, the parties involved, the jurisdictions, and the specific agreements in place. Here is a general overview of what these terms might involve in terms of payment amounts:

1. **Settlement:**
   - This refers to the actual transfer of money or assets once trade or transaction terms have been agreed upon.
   - Payment amounts can range from small transactions, such as an individual's utility bill payment, to large transactions like the purchase of a company, which can be in the billions of dollars.
   - For retail transactions, settlement amounts can be in the range of a few dollars to several thousand dollars.
   - For institutional or wholesale transactions, settlement amounts can be much larger, ranging from tens of thousands to millions or more.

2. **Clearing:**
   - Clearing involves the process of verifying and processing transactions to ensure that the parties meet their obligations.
   - Payment amounts can vary depending on the type of transaction. For example, in financial markets, clearinghouse transactions can involve significant sums, with margins or collateral posted often being substantial amounts, ranging from thousands to millions of dollars.
   - For smaller, retail-oriented clearing, such as checks or ACH transfers, the amounts can be much smaller, ranging from a few dollars to several thousand dollars.

3. **Banking:**
   - This encompasses a wide range of services, including deposit accounts, loans, and transfer of funds.
   - Payment amounts for personal banking transactions can range from very small (e.g., a few dollars for a coffee purchase) to larger amounts for mortgages, personal loans, or business transactions.
   - Corporate banking transactions can involve much larger sums, with loans or transfers potentially reaching tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars.

4. **Cross-border clearing:**
   - This involves the transfer of funds across international borders and can include currency conversion.
   - Payment amounts can vary from small remittances sent by individuals to foreign countries, which might range from a few dollars to a few thousand dollars, to large commercial payments or international trade transactions, which can run into the millions or even billions of dollars.

In all cases, the actual payment amounts are determined by the nature of the transaction, the terms of the agreement between the parties, and the regulations of the financial systems through which the transactions are cleared and settled. There are also fees and charges associated with these transactions, which can vary and might be a percentage of the transaction amount or flat fees.
