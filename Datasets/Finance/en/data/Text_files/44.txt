It seems like you are referring to the details that are typically included on a qualification certificate. However, since I don't have access to specific documents or databases, I can't provide actual details of a real certificate. Below is a template of what information might be included on a qualification certificate:

- **Qualification Certificate**: Professional Diploma in Information Technology
- **Number**: 123456789
- **Issuing Institution**: The Institute of Computer Science and Technology
- **Effective Date**: January 1, 2020
- **Expiration Date**: This can vary. Some certificates do not expire, while others might have an expiration date, for example, December 31, 2025

In real-life scenarios, the effective date is usually the date when the certificate is officially awarded or when the qualification is confirmed. The expiration date is relevant for certifications that require periodic renewal to ensure the holder's knowledge and skills remain current. If you need details for a specific certificate, you would need to contact the issuing institution.
