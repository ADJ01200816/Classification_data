Protecting the physical facilities of financial institutions is a multi-layered task that involves a variety of security measures and detailed planning. Below are some key aspects of the security design documents and plans that should be considered to safeguard the physical assets of a financial institution, including vaults, cash transport routes, monitoring systems, and customer-facing outlets like ATMs and self-service banking facilities.

### 1. Risk Assessment and Security Policies
- **Risk Assessment:** Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities through comprehensive risk assessments.
- **Security Policies:** Develop clear security policies that outline the measures to protect physical assets.

### 2. Vault Security Plans
- **Location:** Vaults should be located in a central, easily monitored area within the facility.
- **Construction:** Use high-grade materials that resist forced entry, including reinforced concrete and steel.
- **Locking Mechanisms:** Implement multiple, fail-safe locking mechanisms that are not dependent on a single point of failure.
- **Access Control:** Strictly limit access to authorized personnel only, using biometric systems where possible.
- **Alarm Systems:** Integrate intrusion detection systems with the overall alarm system for the facility.

### 3. Cash Transport Routes
- **Secrecy:** Maintain the confidentiality of cash transport routes and schedules.
- **Varying Routes and Times:** Use varied routes and times to avoid predictability.
- **Armored Vehicles:** Employ armored vehicles with GPS tracking and communication systems.
- **Escort:** Provide trained armed security guards to escort the cash during transport.

### 4. Monitoring and Alarm System Design Plans
- **Surveillance Cameras:** Install high-resolution cameras to cover all critical areas, including entry points, exits, the vault, and transaction areas.
- **Recording Systems:** Ensure continuous recording with a retention period that complies with legal requirements.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems:** Use sensors on windows, doors, and other access points to detect unauthorized entry.
- **Access Control Integration:** Connect the alarm system with the access control system to trigger alerts in case of unauthorized access attempts.
- **24/7 Monitoring:** Have a central station monitor the alarms and video feeds around the clock.

### 5. Business Outlets, ATMs, and Self-Service Banking
- **Perimeter Security:** Implement barriers, bollards, and other measures to protect against vehicle ramming attacks.
- **ATM Security:** Use anti-skimming devices, transaction monitoring for fraud prevention, and tamper-evident enclosures.
- **Customer Safety:** Design the layout to ensure clear visibility and to prevent entrapment or cornering.
- **Lighting:** Ensure adequate lighting inside and outside the facility to deter criminals and aid in surveillance.

### 6. Security Design Documents
- **Facility Layouts:** Detailed architectural plans that include camera placements, sensor locations, and security station placements.
- **System Specifications:** Technical specifications for security systems, including alarm panels, cameras, and access control hardware.
- **Procedures:** Detailed procedures for response to alarms, emergencies, and other incidents.
- **Testing and Maintenance Schedules:** Regular testing of security systems and maintenance activities to ensure reliability.

### 7. Compliance and Continual Improvement
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Adhere to local, state, and federal regulations regarding the security of financial institutions.
- **Training:** Regular training for staff on security procedures, emergency response, and recognition of suspicious activities.
- **Review and Update:** Continually review and update security plans and documents in response to evolving threats and technologies.

The design and implementation of security measures for financial institutions require a holistic approach and collaboration among security experts, architects, IT professionals, and law enforcement. It's essential to maintain a balance between security, customer convenience, and operational efficiency.
