John Doe, a resident of the United States, frequently utilizes his Visa credit card for various transactions. His latest purchase, a high-end laptop, was made through an online electronics retailer. The transaction, recorded on March 15, 2023, amounted to $2,500. To manage this expense, John opted for a 12-month installment plan, which breaks down the total cost into monthly payments of $208.33. Additionally, the financial institution that issued his credit card imposes a monthly handling fee of $5 for the installment service, bringing his total monthly payment to $213.33. The installment data is meticulously documented in his monthly credit card statements, which also reflect the remaining balance and the number of installment periods left. As of April 2023, John has successfully completed one installment, leaving him with 11 more payments to clear the debt. The handling fees, though nominal, accumulate over the duration of the installment plan, contributing to the overall cost of the purchase. Each installment payment is automatically deducted from John's linked checking account on the 15th of every month, ensuring timely repayment and maintaining his credit score. The detailed breakdown of these transactions and fees is accessible through his online banking portal, which provides real-time updates and notifications regarding his credit card activities.
