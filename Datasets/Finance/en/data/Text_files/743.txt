In the context of a financial credit information basic database, the data reveals that there are 45 urban commercial banks and 6 state-owned commercial banks contributing to the credit management business. Each urban commercial bank maintains an average of 200,000 credit records, while each state-owned commercial bank holds approximately 500,000 such records. The database is updated monthly, ensuring that the latest financial activities, including loan approvals and repayments, are reflected accurately. The total number of credit transactions processed by these institutions in the last fiscal year was 3.2 million, with a cumulative credit issuance amounting to 150 billion yuan. The state-owned commercial banks account for 60% of this total credit issuance, demonstrating their significant role in the credit market. The urban commercial banks, although smaller in number, contribute 40% of the credit transactions, indicating their substantial impact on local economies. The database also tracks default rates, which currently stand at 2.5% for urban commercial banks and 1.8% for state-owned commercial banks, reflecting the varying risk profiles of borrowers across these institutions. Additionally, the database includes detailed information on collateral assets, with real estate comprising 70% of the total collateral value, followed by vehicles at 20% and other assets at 10%. This comprehensive data set is crucial for risk assessment and credit scoring models used by financial institutions to make informed lending decisions.
