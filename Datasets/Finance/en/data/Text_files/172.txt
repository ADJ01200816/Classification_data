In the third quarter of 2023, the urban housing prices in Beijing exhibited a median value of 85,000 yuan per square meter, reflecting a 5.2% increase compared to the same period last year. The implementation of the "Housing Market Stabilization Measure No. 18" by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development led to a noticeable moderation in the rate of price growth. This regulatory framework imposed stricter lending criteria, requiring a minimum down payment of 40% for second homes, thereby curbing speculative activities. Additionally, the local government's initiative to increase the supply of affordable housing units by 15% annually has started to alleviate the demand pressure. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics indicate that the transaction volume in the residential sector decreased by 8.3% quarter-on-quarter, signaling a cooling trend. Concurrently, the introduction of a property tax pilot program in Shanghai and Chongqing, which levies an annual tax of 0.5% to 1.2% on property values exceeding 3 million yuan, has further influenced investor behavior. The combined effect of these measures has resulted in a more balanced real estate landscape, with the average mortgage interest rate stabilizing at 5.35%, down from 5.7% at the beginning of the year. These policy interventions have been instrumental in shaping a more sustainable and regulated market environment.
