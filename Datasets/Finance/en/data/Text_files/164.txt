It seems like you're referring to three distinct concepts that are often used in business and marketing. Let's define each of them:

1. **Unit Value**: This refers to the value of a single unit of a product or service. It is essentially the price at which the unit is sold to the customer. The unit value can be influenced by various factors including production cost, demand, competition, perceived value by the customer, and the company's pricing strategy.

   In a financial context, the unit value might also refer to the net asset value (NAV) per unit in cases of investment funds or trusts, representing the value of the assets minus liabilities divided by the number of units outstanding.

2. **Customer Rating**: This is a measure of customer satisfaction and perception of a product, service, or brand. Customer ratings are typically given in the form of stars, points, or through written reviews. They often reflect aspects such as the quality, performance, price, and customer service associated with the offering. High customer ratings can lead to increased trust, sales, and brand loyalty, while low ratings can have the opposite effect.

   Customer ratings are often used by potential customers to make purchasing decisions and by businesses to identify areas for improvement.

3. **Contribution**: In a business context, contribution refers to the amount of money that a product, service, or business unit adds to the company's profits after covering its own direct costs. It does not include overhead or indirect costs, which are typically allocated separately.

   Contribution margin is a related concept, which is the contribution per unit minus the variable costs per unit. It is a key figure in break-even analysis and helps in making decisions about product lines, pricing, and cost structure. The contribution margin can indicate how much each unit sold contributes to covering the company's fixed costs and eventually to its profit.

Understanding and effectively managing unit value, customer rating, and contribution are all important for running a successful business. Each provides unique insights that can help a company optimize its operations, pricing, marketing, and customer service.
