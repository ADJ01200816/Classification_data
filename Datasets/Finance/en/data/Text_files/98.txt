When dealing with a loan business, various terms and concepts come into play, especially when discussing loan extensions. Below are explanations for each of the terms you mentioned:

1. **Loan Business**:
   A loan business, often referred to as a lending business, involves a financial institution or private lender providing funds to borrowers, which are repaid over time with interest. This business can range from small-scale operations to large commercial banks.

2. **Extension**:
   In the context of a loan, an extension refers to the process of prolonging the还款 period of an existing loan. This is typically done when a borrower is unable to meet the original repayment schedule but is expected to be able to repay over a longer period.

3. **Extension Period**:
   This is the additional time period granted to the borrower to repay the loan. For instance, if a loan was originally due in 12 months and an extension of 6 months is granted, the new loan term would be 18 months.

4. **Extension Interest Rate**:
   The interest rate applied to the loan for the extended period. This rate can be the same as the original loan's interest rate, or it might be higher, reflecting the increased risk to the lender due to the extension.

5. **Extension Amount**:
   This refers to the additional amount that the borrower is allowed to owe as a result of the loan extension. This could be the remaining unpaid balance of the loan, or it may include additional funds borrowed as part of the extension agreement.

6. **Extension Frequency**:
   This term could refer to how often the lender allows for loan extensions or the frequency at which payments are to be made during the extension period. For instance, if the original loan had monthly payments, the extension might also require monthly payments, or it could change to quarterly payments, etc.

7. **Extension Reason**:
   The reason provided by the borrower for needing a loan extension. Common reasons might include financial hardship, changes in the borrower's personal circumstances, or unexpected business challenges that affect their ability to repay the loan as initially agreed.

When a borrower requests an extension, the lender will typically assess the situation, including the reason for the extension request, the borrower's ability to repay over the extended period, and the risk involved in granting the extension. If agreed upon, the lender will then outline the terms of the extension, including the period, interest rate, amount, and any other relevant details, which will be formalized in an extension agreement or an amendment to the original loan contract.
