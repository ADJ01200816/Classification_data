Financial institutions are entities that provide a variety of financial and banking services to individuals and businesses. Below is an overview of the terms and services you mentioned:

1. **Consumer Credit**: This is a type of debt that individuals take on to purchase goods or services. Consumer credit can come in the form of installment loans, which are repaid over time according to a predetermined schedule, or revolving credit, which allows individuals to borrow up to a certain limit, repay, and borrow again.

2. **Transfer Settlement**: This refers to the process of exchanging cash, securities, or derivatives between buyers and sellers. In the context of banking, it typically refers to the transfer of funds from one account to another, which can be done within the same bank or across different banks. Settlement is the actual transfer of money or assets following a trade.

3. **Cash Deposits and Withdrawals**: These are transactions where customers deposit physical cash into their bank accounts or withdraw cash from their accounts. This can be done at bank branches, ATMs, or sometimes through cash deposit machines.

Here are the details of the payment tools and services:

4. **Credit Payment Tools**: These are methods that allow consumers to make purchases on credit, deferring payment until a later date. Credit payment tools include:

    - **Credit Cards**: A credit card is a payment card issued by a financial institution that enables the cardholder to make purchases on credit. The cardholder is required to pay back the borrowed amount, often with interest, either in full at the end of the billing cycle or over time with minimum monthly payments.

    - **Buy now, pay later services**: These are an alternative to traditional credit cards, often offered by specific retailers or fintech companies, allowing consumers to spread payments over several installments.

5. **Debit Card Services**: A debit card is a payment card that allows the cardholder to make purchases by deducting funds directly from their bank account. Here are some aspects of debit card services:

    - **Transactions**: Debit cards can be used to pay for goods and services in stores, online, or withdraw cash from ATMs.
    
    - **Funds Transfer**: They can also be used for transferring funds between bank accounts.
    
    - **Direct Debit**: Some bills can be set up to be automatically paid from a bank account using the debit card information.

The relationship between these services and financial institutions is that banks and credit unions typically issue credit and debit cards, facilitate the transfer of funds, and are the channels through which consumer credit is extended. They are also the primary points of interaction for customers who wish to deposit or withdraw cash from their accounts. The infrastructure and regulatory framework provided by these institutions allow for secure and efficient transactions that are fundamental to the functioning of the economy.
