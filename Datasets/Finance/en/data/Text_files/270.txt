The terms you mentioned are related to the banking and financial industry. Here's an explanation of each term:

1. **Payment Settlement Business:**
   This refers to the process through which payments between parties are cleared and settled. It involves the transfer of funds from the payer to the payee, often through a complex system that includes banks, payment processors, and clearinghouses. In a payment settlement, the final transfer of funds is confirmed, and the transaction is considered complete. This business is crucial for maintaining liquidity and stability in the financial markets and ensuring that all parties to a transaction are paid as per the agreement.

2. **Special Deposit Business Information:**
   This term is not as widely standardized as others, but it likely refers to specific details about deposits that are made under special terms or conditions, which differ from regular deposit accounts. These special deposits may come with different interest rates, withdrawal restrictions, or other specific conditions tailored to the needs of the depositor or the bank's requirements. The information about such deposits would include the terms of the deposit, the parties involved, the amount deposited, the duration of the deposit, and any other conditions applicable.

3. **Special Deposit Business Accounting Date:**
   The accounting date for a special deposit refers to the specific date on which the financial institution recognizes the deposit in its accounting records. This date is important for financial reporting and regulatory compliance, as it determines when the deposit is counted as an asset for the bank and when it starts earning interest for the depositor. For special deposits, the accounting date might differ from the date the deposit is actually made due to specific business rules or agreements.

4. **Special Deposit Withdrawal Amount:**
   This refers to the specific amount that can be withdrawn from a special deposit account, which may be subject to different rules than those for regular accounts. The withdrawal amount could be limited by a minimum or maximum threshold, or there might be penalties or conditions associated with early withdrawal. The special deposit agreement would outline the terms under which withdrawals can be made, including the amounts that are allowed to be withdrawn and any potential fees or interest adjustments.

Understanding these terms is important for financial institutions and customers engaging in special deposit accounts and payment settlements, as they affect the financial operations and reporting, as well as the rights and obligations of the parties involved.
