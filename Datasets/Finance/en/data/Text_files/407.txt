Financial institutions are entities that provide financial services to customers, such as banks, credit unions, insurance companies, and investment firms. They must adhere to a complex web of work orders, laws, regulations, policies, norms, and guidance to ensure they operate in a legal and ethical manner. Below is a brief overview of each term in the context of financial institutions:

1. **Work Order**: This is a document that authorizes work to be performed, usually detailing the tasks, materials, and labor required for a project. In a financial institution, work orders might pertain to IT projects, facility management, or other operational tasks.

2. **Laws**: These are rules that are codified and enforceable by the judicial system. Financial institutions must comply with various laws such as banking laws, consumer protection laws, and anti-money laundering laws.

3. **Regulations**: These are rules and administrative codes that are promulgated by government agencies. They have the force of law and are often created to implement the specifics of laws passed by the legislature. Financial institutions are subject to numerous regulations such as those dictated by the Federal Reserve or the SEC.

4. **Policies**: Policies are principles or guidelines that an organization sets to govern its activities. In financial institutions, policies outline how different processes should be conducted, including risk management, lending practices, and customer privacy.

5. **Norms**: These are the unwritten rules or standards of behavior that are considered acceptable in a particular group or society. In the financial industry, norms can influence how business is conducted, even if they are not legally binding.

6. **Guidance**: Guidance often refers to non-binding advice or recommendations provided by regulatory bodies. While not enforceable by law, financial institutions typically follow guidance to stay in compliance with regulatory expectations.

7. **Binding Force**: This term refers to the legal obligation to comply with laws, regulations, or contracts. In the case of financial institutions, contracts with customers, or the articles of association, have a binding force.

8. **Articles of Association**: These are a company’s bylaws that define its purpose, how it is run, and how decisions are made. They are a key component of the company’s corporate governance structure.

9. **Electronic Document Data**: This refers to the digital representation of paper documents that are stored and managed electronically. For financial institutions, this includes customer records, transaction histories, and other sensitive data.

10. **Company Articles of Association**: Similar to the general definition, this specifically refers to the bylaws of a company that dictate how the company is governed and operated.

11. **Company Financial Management System**: This is a system that manages a company’s financial processes, including budgeting, accounting, and financial reporting. It is crucial for ensuring compliance with financial regulations and standards.

12. **Company Asset Management System**: This system is designed to manage an organization’s assets effectively, including investments, properties, and equipment. For financial institutions, this includes managing the risks associated with their asset portfolios.

13. **IT Governance System**: IT governance involves the processes and structures for ensuring that the organization's IT aligns with business goals and supports the organization's strategies. It ensures that IT investments generate value and that risks are managed appropriately.

14. **IT (Information Technology) Management System**: This is a broader framework that encompasses the planning, deployment, and management of IT resources within an organization. It includes IT governance but also covers the day-to-day operational aspects of IT.

Financial institutions must navigate and integrate all these aspects into their daily operations to maintain compliance, manage risks, and provide quality services to their customers.
