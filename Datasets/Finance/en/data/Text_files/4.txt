When referring to a location, the terms you mentioned—country, city, region, street, longitude, and latitude—collectively provide a detailed geographic description. Here's how they are typically used:

1. **Country**: The largest political division, representing a sovereign state or a territory with a defined set of borders.

2. **City**: A large town or urban area, usually with a defined municipality and local government.

3. **Region**: A part of a country that has a particular characteristic, such as a natural feature, a common culture, or economic affinities. In some countries, regions are official administrative divisions.

4. **Street**: A public road in a city, town, or village, typically with houses and buildings on one or both sides.

The following provide precise geographic coordinates:

5. **Longitude**: The vertical lines on a map that measure east and west from the Prime Meridian (which passes through Greenwich, London). It is a measurement of the distance in degrees east or west from this line.

6. **Latitude**: The horizontal lines on a map that measure north and south of the Equator. It is a measurement of the distance in degrees north or south from the Equator.

When discussing the "current location," these details can be used to pinpoint exactly where a person or object is:

- **Current Country**: The country in which the location is found.
- **Current City or Town**: The city or town within the country.
- **Current Region**: The region of the country, if applicable.
- **Current Street**: The specific street address, if available.
- **Current Longitude and Latitude**: The precise geographic coordinates that can be used to identify the location on a map or in a geographic information system (GIS).

For example, a full current location description might be:

"I am currently located at 123 Main Street, in the city of Beijing, in the region of China's North China Plain, China. The coordinates are approximately 39.9042° N latitude and 116.4074° E longitude."

This information would provide a detailed location that could be easily pinpointed on a map.
