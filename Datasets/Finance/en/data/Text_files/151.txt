On the 15th of each month, the payment settlement business operated by ABC Company processes transactions totaling 3.5 million yuan. The partnering financial institutions, including XYZ Bank and DEF Credit Union, are required to maintain an RMB deposit reserve. For instance, XYZ Bank holds a reserve of 1.2 million yuan, while DEF Credit Union maintains 800,000 yuan. These reserves are recorded on the deposit date, which is consistently the last business day of the month. Adhering to the regulatory framework, these institutions comply with the statutory deposit reserve ratio of 7.5%. Consequently, XYZ Bank's reserve constitutes 7.5% of its total deposits, and DEF Credit Union's reserve reflects the same percentage of its holdings. The precise tracking and reporting of these figures ensure compliance with financial regulations and facilitate efficient monetary policy implementation.
