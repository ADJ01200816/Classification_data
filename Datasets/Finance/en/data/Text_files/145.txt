To provide you with specific investor information such as the controlling shareholder's name, registered capital, and paid-in capital, I would need to know the exact name of the company you are inquiring about. These details are typically found in the company's official registration documents, annual reports, and other financial disclosures that are often publicly available for publicly traded companies.

For a publicly traded company, this information might be available through:

1. The company's official website in the investor relations section.
2. Filings with regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States or the equivalent in other jurisdictions.
3. Stock exchange websites where the company is listed.
4. Business databases and financial information providers such as Bloomberg, Hoovers, or Reuters.

If you provide the company's name, I can guide you on how to find this information. However, please note that I am unable to access real-time databases or proprietary sources to retrieve this information directly.
