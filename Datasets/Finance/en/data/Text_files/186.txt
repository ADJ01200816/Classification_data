Commercial banks, fund management companies, funds, and various entities involved in the financial services industry play distinct roles in the investment and capital management process. Let's break down each of these terms and concepts:

**Commercial Banks:**
Commercial banks are financial institutions that provide services to the general public and businesses, such as accepting deposits, offering checking and savings accounts, securing loans, and facilitating payments. They may also engage in investment activities and provide wealth management services.

**Fund Management Companies:**
These are companies that pool money from investors to form investment funds, which are then managed on their behalf. Fund management companies employ professionals who make investment decisions and manage the assets of the fund with the goal of achieving returns that align with the investors' objectives.

**Funds:**
Funds are investment vehicles that collect money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Types of funds include mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), hedge funds, and pension funds, each with different investment strategies and objectives.

**Fund Clearing Funds:**
Clearing funds refers to the process by which transactions involving the exchange of money for securities and other assets are settled. In the context of funds, clearing funds would involve the movement of cash to and from the fund in order to settle the purchases and sales of assets held within the fund, as well asredemptions by investors.

**Accounting:**
Accounting for funds involves the recording, analyzing, and reporting of financial transactions. This includes tracking investments, calculating fund values, ensuring compliance with financial regulations, and preparing financial statements for investors and regulators.

**Fund Valuation:**
Valuation is the process of determining the fair value or market value of the investments in a fund. Fund valuation is crucial for pricing shares or units of the fund accurately when investors buy into or redeem from the fund. It is typically performed at the end of each trading day.

**Management Supervision:**
This refers to the oversight of fund management activities to ensure that they comply with laws, regulations, and the fund's internal policies. Management supervision involves monitoring the fund manager's performance and the fund's operations to protect the interests of investors.

**Investment Operations:**
Investment operations encompass the day-to-day activities related to the management of investment portfolios. This includes trade execution, portfolio accounting, risk management, compliance, and the reconciliation of investment transactions.

**Investment Fund Custody Business:**
Custody services involve the safekeeping of a fund's assets, such as stocks, bonds, and other securities. The investment fund custody business is responsible for the administrative and logistical support related to the assets in a fund, including settlement of trades, collecting dividends and interest, and providing information on the composition and valuation of the fund's portfolio.

All these functions are integral to the operation of the financial markets and the investment fund industry, ensuring the smooth flow of capital, transparency, and protection for investors.
