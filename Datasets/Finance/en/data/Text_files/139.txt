In the realm of credit management business, the financial credit information basic database serves as a pivotal repository. This database encompasses data from various financial institutions, including 15 urban commercial banks and 4 state-owned commercial banks. Each urban commercial bank contributes an average of 200,000 credit records per month, while each state-owned commercial bank inputs approximately 500,000 records. The database meticulously records details such as loan amounts, repayment histories, and credit scores. For instance, Bank A, an urban commercial bank, reported a total loan disbursement of $150 million in the last quarter, with an average credit score of 720 among its borrowers. Conversely, Bank B, a state-owned entity, recorded a higher disbursement of $300 million, with an average credit score of 740. These records are essential for assessing the creditworthiness of individuals and businesses, facilitating informed lending decisions across the financial sector. The integration of data from both types of banks ensures a comprehensive view of the credit landscape, aiding in risk management and regulatory compliance.
