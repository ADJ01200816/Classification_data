The details you've mentioned pertain to specific information that would be found on an institutional business license certificate. However, without access to actual documents or databases, I cannot provide real certificate numbers, types, issuance dates, or destruction dates. Each of these elements is defined as follows:

- **Institutional Business License Certificate**: This is a document issued by a government agency that authorizes an institution to conduct business legally within a certain jurisdiction. It typically includes the name of the institution, the nature of the business, and various identifying details.

- **Certificate Number**: This is a unique identifier assigned to the business license certificate. It is used for tracking and verification purposes.

- **Certificate Type**: This refers to the category or class of the business license. There are various types depending on the nature of the business and the regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction, such as general business license, professional license, or specific activity license.

- **Certificate Issuance Date**: This is the date on which the certificate was officially issued to the business by the licensing authority.

- **Certificate Destruction Date**: This is the date on which the certificate is scheduled to be destroyed or becomes invalid, which might occur if the business is no longer operational, the license is revoked, or it is superceded by a new certificate.

If you are seeking information about a specific business license, you would typically need to contact the government agency responsible for business registration and licensing in the jurisdiction where the business operates. They would be able to provide this information based on public records, as long as the request complies with applicable privacy and freedom of information laws.
