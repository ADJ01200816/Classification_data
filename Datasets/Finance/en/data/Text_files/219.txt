In order to provide a hypothetical example of a reinsurance claim case, I will create a scenario with relevant details. Please note that the following is a fictional case for illustrative purposes only:

**Reinsurance Contract Name**: Global RiskShield Reinsurance Treaty

**Business Year**: 2022

**Insurance Subject**: Catastrophic Property Damage Insurance

**Insured Amount**: USD 100 million

**Payout Ratio**: 80% (The reinsurer would cover 80% of the claim amount after the insured's retention, which is a common arrangement in reinsurance contracts)

**Estimated Claim**: USD 50 million

**Estimated Amortized Amount Under the Contract**: USD 40 million (This is 80% of the estimated claim, as per the payout ratio)

**Date of Claim Occurrence**: April 15, 2022

**Location of Claim Occurrence**: Miami, Florida, USA

**Actual Information on Claim Recovery**:

- The actual claim amount paid out was USD 47 million, slightly higher than the initial estimate due to additional damage assessments post-occurrence.
- The reinsurer paid out USD 37.6 million, reflecting the 80% payout ratio, after the insured's retention was applied.
- The claim was settled on August 1, 2022, after a thorough investigation and negotiation period.
- Recovery efforts included coordination with local authorities and disaster relief organizations to assess and mitigate the damage.
- The recovery process also involved working with loss adjusters and legal teams to ensure that the claim was handled in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance contract.
- The location of the claim occurrence, Miami, experienced extensive property damage due to a category 5 hurricane, leading to the large claim amount.

In a real-world scenario, the actual information on claim recovery would be confidential and subject to legal and privacy considerations. It would also involve more detailed financial and technical analysis, along with potential disputes and arbitration processes.
