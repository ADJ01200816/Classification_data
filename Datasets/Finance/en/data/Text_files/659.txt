The agreement specifies that the commencement of the contractual period is set for January 15, 2023, marking the initial date from which all stipulated terms and conditions become operative. The termination of this agreement is delineated to occur on December 31, 2027, thereby establishing the final date of the contract's validity. The method for settling interest accrued is outlined as an annual compounding process, ensuring that the interest is added to the principal amount at the end of each calendar year. The benchmark utilized for calculating the interest is explicitly defined as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), with a specific reference to the three-month LIBOR rate prevailing at the time of each interest calculation cycle. The period over which interest is computed is detailed to be quarterly, meaning that interest is calculated and, if applicable, compounded every three months, aligning with the established financial quarters of the calendar year.
