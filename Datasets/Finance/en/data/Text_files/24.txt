It seems like you're referring to the concept of tagging or flagging customers as "high-risk" based on personal risk information that is often collected and analyzed by financial institutions, insurance companies, and sometimes by e-commerce platforms and other service providers. This process typically involves the use of data from various tags or labels that help identify potential risks. Here's a brief explanation of these terms:

1. **Personal Risk Information:**
   - This includes data related to an individual's risk profile, which can consist of financial history, transaction behavior, credit score, past compliance issues, or any other information that might indicate a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behavior or transactions.
   - Personal risk information is often gathered through customer due diligence processes and can be updated regularly to reflect the latest information about the customer.

2. **Tag Data:**
   - Tags are labels or identifiers assigned to customers or transactions that help categorize and manage risk.
   - These can be simple (e.g., "high net worth individual," "international transactions") or complex (e.g., "pattern of suspicious activity," "high-frequency trading") depending on the context and the level of detail required for risk assessment.
   - Tag data can be created manually by risk analysts or automatically through the use of algorithms that detect patterns and anomalies in customer behavior.

3. **High-Risk Customer Tags:**
   - These are specific tags assigned to customers who are deemed higher risk based on the personal risk information and tag data.
   - High-risk tags might be applied due to factors such as geographical location, known association with high-risk industries, a history of money laundering or fraud, or engaging in transactions that deviate significantly from the customer's typical behavior.
   - Once a customer is tagged as high-risk, the institution may apply additional monitoring, conduct further due diligence, or take other risk mitigation measures to comply with regulations and protect against potential losses or reputational damage.

It's important to note that the use of personal risk information and the application of high-risk tags must comply with relevant privacy laws, financial regulations, and anti-discrimination laws. Companies are required to ensure that their risk assessment processes are fair, transparent, and based on accurate information.
