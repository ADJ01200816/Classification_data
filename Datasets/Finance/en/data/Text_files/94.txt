When dealing with a loan business, credit-related data is crucial for the assessment and management of risks and opportunities. Below are the key pieces of information associated with credit, along with explanations for each:

1. **Credit Type**: This refers to the category of loan provided to the borrower. Types can include:
    - Personal Loan
    - Business Loan
    - Mortgages
    - Auto Loans
    - Student Loans
    - Revolving Credit (e.g., credit cards)
    - Term Loan
    - Secured/Unsecured Loan

2. **Credit Purpose**: The intended use of the borrowed funds. Common purposes include:
    - Business expansion
    - Working capital
    - Purchase of equipment or inventory
    - Real estate acquisition
    - Debt consolidation
    - Education expenses
    - Personal use (e.g., home improvement, travel)

3. **Credit Currency**: The currency in which the loan is denominated. This could be the local currency or a foreign currency, and it affects the borrower's exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations.

4. **Credit Term**: This is the duration for which the credit facility is provided, or the length of time over which the borrower is required to repay the loan. It can range from short-term (e.g., 90 days) to long-term (e.g., 30 years).

5. **Start Date**: The date when the credit agreement becomes effective and the borrower can begin to use the funds.

6. **End Date**: The date when the borrower is expected to have fully repaid the loan, assuming regular payments are made as scheduled. This is also the maturity date of the loan.

Relevant data information related to these aspects may include:

- **Borrower Information**: Name, contact details, identification numbers, and credit history.
- **Loan Amount**: The principal amount borrowed.
- **Interest Rate**: The rate at which the loan will accrue interest.
- **Amortization Schedule**: A table detailing each payment amount and how it is split between interest and principal.
- **Payment Frequency**: How often the borrower must make payments (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
- **Collateral Details**: Description of any assets that secure the loan.
- **Guarantors or Co-signers**: Information about individuals or entities that agree to assume responsibility for the loan if the borrower defaults.
- **Financial Ratios**: Information such as debt-to-income ratio, used to assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan.
- **Credit Score**: A numerical representation of the borrower's creditworthiness.

The collection and analysis of such data help the lender make informed decisions about the approval of loans, set terms and conditions, and monitor the loan performance over time.
