The credit card business involves the issuance of cards by financial institutions to individuals or businesses, allowing them to borrow money up to a certain credit limit to make purchases or withdraw cash. The transactions made using credit cards generate consumption data, which typically includes details such as the consumption amount, consumption date, and remaining credit limit. Here's a breakdown of what each of these terms means:

1. **Consumption Data**: This refers to the information related to the transactions made using a credit card. It includes various details about each purchase, cash advance, or other transactions.

2. **Consumption Amount**: This is the total value of a transaction made with a credit card. It reflects the cost of goods or services purchased or the amount of cash withdrawn.

   - For example, if you buy groceries worth $50 with your credit card, the consumption amount is $50.

3. **Consumption Date**: This is the date on which the transaction occurred. It helps in tracking when a particular purchase was made.

   - Continuing from the previous example, if you bought groceries on January 15th, the consumption date would be January 15th.

4. **Remaining Credit Limit**: This is the amount of credit still available for the cardholder to use on their credit card. It is calculated by subtracting the total of all outstanding transactions and pending authorizations from the credit card's total credit limit.

   - Suppose your credit card has a total credit limit of $1,000, and you have a balance of $200 and a pending authorization of $150. Your remaining credit limit would be $650 ($1,000 - $200 - $150).

The credit card issuer uses consumption data to assess a cardholder's creditworthiness, spending habits, and to manage risk. This information also helps in detecting fraudulent activities, customizing offers, and determining credit limits. Consumers can use this data to manage their finances by tracking their spending, ensuring they do not exceed their credit limit, and staying within their budget.
