The contractual agreement specifies that the commencement of the term is set for January 15, 2023, marking the initial point at which all stipulated conditions and obligations come into effect. The termination of this agreement is scheduled for December 31, 2027, indicating the final date by which all parties must have fulfilled their respective duties under the contract. The method for settling interest payments is outlined as quarterly compounding, wherein accrued interest is added to the principal amount at the end of each three-month period, thereby influencing subsequent interest calculations. The benchmark utilized for determining the interest rate is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), specifically the one-month LIBOR, which serves as a reference point for adjusting the applicable interest rate in alignment with prevailing market conditions. The interest period is defined as a six-month interval, commencing from the effective start date of the agreement, during which the calculated interest is assessed and applied to the outstanding balance. This structured approach ensures clarity and consistency in the financial obligations and expectations of all involved parties throughout the duration of the contract.
