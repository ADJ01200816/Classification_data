The terms you've provided seem to be related to a process of official review and authorization within an administrative or bureaucratic context. Here's how they might be defined and how they could be used in a sentence:

1. **Approval Result**: This refers to the outcome of a review process where a decision is made whether to approve or reject a proposal, request, or project.
   - *Example sentence*: "We received the approval result for our project yesterday; thankfully, it was granted."

2. **Notification**: This is the act of informing or alerting someone about a decision or an event.
   - *Example sentence*: "You will receive a formal notification of the approval result once it has been finalized."

3. **Administrative Approval**: This is the formal consent given by an administrative body or official to proceed with a certain action or project.
   - *Example sentence*: "The construction cannot begin until we obtain administrative approval from the city council."

4. **Review Opinion**: This is a comment or judgment made during a review process that reflects the reviewer's perspective on the matter being considered.
   - *Example sentence*: "The review opinion from the department head highlighted several areas that needed improvement before the application could be granted approval."

In a typical workflow, an individual or organization might submit a request for some form of administrative approval. After a review period, a review opinion would be formed, leading to an approval result. Once the result is determined, a notification would be sent to the relevant party to inform them of the decision.
