These terms are commonly associated with the process of borrowing money through a loan. Below is an explanation of each term:

1. **Loan Disbursement Date**: This is the date on which the lender releases the loan amount to the borrower. It's the day the actual funds are credited to the borrower's account or when they receive the cash or check.

2. **Loan Amount**: This is the total amount of money that the borrower receives from the lender. It's the principal amount that needs to be repaid over time, usually along with interest.

3. **Repayment Method**: This refers to the method or methods by which the borrower is expected to repay the loan. Common repayment methods include:

    - Direct Debit: Automatic deductions from the borrower's bank account.
    - Checks: Mailing a check to the lender.
    - Online Payments: Using the lender's online portal to make payments.
    - Money Orders or Cashier's Checks.

4. **Repayment Amount**: This is the total amount the borrower must pay back to the lender each period. It typically includes both the principal amount and the interest accrued over that period.

5. **Repayment Date**: This is the scheduled date on which the borrower is required to make a loan repayment. For installment loans, there will be multiple repayment dates, usually at regular intervals (e.g., monthly, bi-weekly).

Below is an example of how these terms might be listed for a specific loan:
