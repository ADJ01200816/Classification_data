As a financial consumer, you may have various interactions with financial service providers, including consultations, complaints, and associated processes. Below is an explanation of each term in the context you've provided:

**Financial Consumer:**
A financial consumer is an individual who uses financial services or products provided by banks, credit unions, insurance companies, investment firms, or other financial institutions. Consumers may have accounts, loans, investments, or insurance policies with these entities.

**Consultation:**
A consultation refers to a formal discussion or meeting between a financial consumer and a representative of a financial service provider. This discussion is aimed at seeking information, advice, or clarification about a financial product or service. It can happen in person, over the phone, or online.

**Complaint:**
A complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction or concern raised by a financial consumer regarding a financial product or service. This could be about issues like unauthorized transactions, service quality, billing errors, or any other matter that the consumer finds unsatisfactory.

Below are the additional terms:

**Consultation Work Order Number:**
This is a unique identifier assigned to a consultation request. When a consumer requests a consultation, the financial service provider may issue a work order number. This number serves as a reference for both the consumer and the service provider to track the progress of the consultation. It helps in managing and documenting the process.

**Consultation Processing Result:**
This refers to the outcome or result of the consultation process. After the consultation is completed, the financial service provider will process the information discussed and provide a result. This could include:

- Solutions or recommendations offered to the consumer.
- Actions taken to resolve the consumer's queries or concerns.
- Additional information provided to the consumer.
- A confirmation that the consultation has been noted, with no further action required.

Hereâ€™s how it might work in a scenario:

- You (the consumer) have a consultation about a new investment product.
- You are given a consultation work order number (e.g., "CONS12345").
- After the consultation, the processing result might be that you are recommended a specific investment plan based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.
- This result would be communicated to you, possibly with a summary of the discussion and next steps.
