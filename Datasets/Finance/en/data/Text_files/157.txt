"Unit owned attributes" and "financial customer tags" are terms that are often used in the context of data management, customer relationship management (CRM), and financial services. Here's a breakdown of each term:

**Unit Owned Attributes:**
In a business or organizational context, "unit owned attributes" typically refer to specific data elements or characteristics that are owned or managed by a particular unit or department within the organization. These attributes are usually relevant to the operations, products, or services that the unit is responsible for.

For example:
- In a retail bank, the "account management" unit might own attributes such as account balance, transaction history, and account status.
- In a university, the "admissions office" might own attributes like application status, admission test scores, and applicant demographics.

These attributes are considered "owned" by the unit because that unit is responsible for maintaining the accuracy, integrity, and security of the data.

**Financial Customer Tags:**
"Financial customer tags" are labels or identifiers used in the financial industry to categorize customers based on various criteria. These tags can be used for a range of purposes, including customer segmentation, risk management, personalized service offerings, marketing, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

Examples of financial customer tags might include:
- Customer segment (e.g., retail, corporate, high net worth)
- Risk level (e.g., low, medium, high)
- Product usage (e.g., savings account customer, credit card user, mortgage holder)
- Service tier (e.g., silver, gold, platinum)
- Regulatory status (e.g., know your customer (KYC) verified, anti-money laundering (AML) risk)

These tags help financial institutions to manage their customer relationships more effectively by providing a quick and easy way to filter and analyze customer data according to specific characteristics or behaviors. They can be particularly useful in compliance efforts, where accurate and up-to-date customer information is critical.

Both unit owned attributes and financial customer tags are integral components of a robust data management strategy, as they enable organizations to make informed decisions, enhance customer experiences, and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
