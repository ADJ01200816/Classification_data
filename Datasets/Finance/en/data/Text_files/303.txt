A cross-border payment system refers to a network that enables the transfer of funds across international borders. These systems are crucial for facilitating trade and commerce between countries. Below, I'll address the terms you've mentioned:

1. **Node Code**: In the context of a cross-border payment system, a node code is a unique identifier assigned to a participant or a node within the network. Each node in the system could represent a financial institution, a payment processor, or any entity that is part of the payment chain. The node code is used to route transactions and ensure that payments are correctly directed to the intended recipient.

- **Purpose**: The node code helps in the clear identification of the entities involved in the transaction and can be used for various purposes such as reconciliation, reporting, and transaction tracking.

2. **Node Activation Date**:

- **Definition**: The node activation date is the date on which a particular node (participant) in the cross-border payment system becomes operational and is able to send or receive transactions through the network.
- **Importance**: This date is important for the following reasons:
  - It marks the beginning of the node's participation in the network.
  - It is used for compliance purposes to ensure that all participants adhere to the rules and regulations.
  - It may trigger certain contractual obligations between the node and the operator of the payment system.

In practical terms, for a financial institution or a service provider, knowing the node activation date is essential for:

- Planning and preparation for going live with the new system.
- Communicating with customers about the availability of new services.
- Ensuring that all technical and operational requirements are met before the activation date.

When dealing with cross-border payment systems, it's important that all participants are aware of their node codes and activation dates to facilitate smooth and efficient transactions.
