As an AI, I don't have personal beliefs, political outlooks, party affiliations, or the ability to join political parties. My purpose is to provide information, answer questions, and assist users with a neutral perspective, respecting all viewpoints and maintaining confidentiality.

If you're asking about how individuals might approach these topics, generally, a person's political outlook is shaped by their values, beliefs, and experiences. Party affiliation is often a reflection of this outlook, where individuals might join a political party that aligns with their views on economic, social, and foreign policy issues.

The time at which someone joins a political party can vary widely. Some individuals might join a party:

1. Early in life, influenced by their family's political leanings.
2. During times of political awakening or when they become eligible to vote.
3. In response to significant political events or changes in personal circumstances.
4. Based on a deep dive into policy research and self-reflection about their values.
5. When they feel a need to become more active in shaping political discourse or outcomes.

People's party affiliations and the timing of when they join can be very personal and are influenced by a complex interplay of factors.
