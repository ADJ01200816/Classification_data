2. **Vehicle**:
   - **Chassis number/VIN code**: A unique serial number used by the automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles.
   - **Vehicle license plate number**: The alphanumeric identification assigned to a vehicle by the jurisdiction in which it is registered.
   - **License plate type**: The category or classification of the vehicle as determined by the licensing authority (e.g., private, commercial).
   - **Vehicle type**: Specifies the category of the vehicle such as car, motorcycle, truck, etc.
   - **Manufacturer and model**: The producer of the vehicle and the specific model it is.
   - **Engine number**: A unique number assigned to identify the vehicle's engine.

3. **House**:
   - Details might include the address, construction type, year of construction, number of rooms, and the estimated value of the property.

4. **Project**:
   - **Project information**: Detailed description of the project, including its purpose, location, the value of the project, and any specific risks involved.

5. **Plot**:
   - **Plot code**: A unique identifier for the land plot.
   - **Plot area**: The size of the land plot, usually measured in square feet or acres.

Insurance policies for each of these subjects are tailored to cover specific risks associated with them. For instance, vehicle insurance may cover accidents and theft, while homeowners' insurance might protect against fire, flood, or other perils. Similarly, crop insurance can protect against weather events that could destroy crops, and forest insurance might cover damage due to natural disasters, fires, or disease.

When applying for insurance, the policyholder would need to provide accurate information about the item being insured to ensure proper coverage and to determine the insurance premium. The insurer would also consider factors such as the location of the property, its use, its value, and the likelihood of the risks it faces to calculate the cost of the insurance.
