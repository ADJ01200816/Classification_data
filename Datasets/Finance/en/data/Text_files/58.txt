These terms are commonly used in the context of financial agreements, particularly in relation to loans and other credit arrangements. Here's an explanation of each term:

1. **Guarantor**: A guarantor is a person or entity that agrees to take responsibility for the debt or obligation of another party if that party fails to fulfill their payment or contractual obligations. In the event that the borrower defaults on their loan, the guarantor is legally bound to pay the remaining debt.

2. **Guarantee Method**: This refers to the way in which the guarantee is provided. There are several guarantee methods, including:
   - **Primary Guarantee**: The guarantor is the first line of defense and is responsible for repaying the debt if the borrower defaults.
   - **Secondary Guarantee**: The guarantor steps in only if the primary obligator (the borrower) cannot fulfill their obligations.
   - **Collateral Guarantee**: The guarantee is secured by a specific asset (collateral) that can be seized if the obligation is not met.

3. **Guarantee Type**: This categorizes the nature of the guarantee provided. Common guarantee types include:
   - **Personal Guarantee**: An individual personally assumes the responsibility for the debt.
   - **Corporate Guarantee**: A company takes on the responsibility to repay the debt if the borrower fails to do so.
   - **Performance Guarantee**: A guarantee that a certain level of performance or completion of a contract will be met.

4. **Guarantee Amount**: This is the specific sum of money or value of assets that the guarantor has agreed to be responsible for in the event of a default. It may be the full amount of the loan or credit extended, or it may be a limited amount.

5. **Guarantee Ratio**: The guarantee ratio is the proportion of the guaranteed amount to the total amount of credit or the value of the underlying obligation. For example, if a guarantor is guaranteeing 50% of a $100,000 loan, the guarantee ratio is 50%. This is often used to determine the risk associated with the transaction and the financial exposure of the guarantor.

In financial transactions, these terms help to clarify the roles, responsibilities, and risks for all parties involved, ensuring that there is a clear understanding of what is expected in case of default.
