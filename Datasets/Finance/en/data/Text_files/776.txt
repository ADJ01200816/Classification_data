In the third quarter of 2023, the urban housing prices in Beijing exhibited a moderate increase, with the average price per square meter reaching 80,000 RMB. This upward trend was influenced by the implementation of new zoning regulations that permitted higher density residential developments in certain districts. The central government's initiative to stimulate economic growth through infrastructure investments also played a role, as it indirectly boosted demand for residential properties near newly developed transportation hubs. Additionally, the local government's decision to lower mortgage interest rates by 0.5 percentage points in July contributed to a 15% rise in home sales compared to the previous quarter. The policy aimed at attracting first-time homebuyers, particularly those with an annual income ranging from 300,000 to 500,000 RMB, by offering tax incentives totaling 20,000 RMB for eligible purchases. Concurrently, the commercial real estate sector in Shanghai saw a 10% decline in vacancy rates, attributed to the relaxation of foreign investment restrictions, which facilitated the entry of international corporations. These entities leased office spaces in the Pudong district, where the average rental rate stood at 150 RMB per square meter per month. The combined effects of these measures resulted in a balanced real estate market, with residential demand being met without causing significant inflationary pressures.
