The financial institution, located in New York City, recently organized a series of conferences focusing on cybersecurity. The events were attended by approximately 200 professionals, including 35 senior executives. The conferences took place over three days, from June 12th to June 14th, at the Marriott Hotel. Each session was secured by a team of 15 security personnel, managed by John Doe, who ensured that all attendees were verified through a biometric scanning system. Additionally, the institution hosted team building activities on the 15th and 16th of June at the Central Park Recreation Center, involving 150 employees. These activities included trust falls, obstacle courses, and problem-solving challenges. Concurrently, party building activities were conducted on June 17th at the institution's headquarters, attended by 80 members of the organization's political committee. The activities included lectures on policy adherence and interactive workshops. All financial records pertaining to these events, including invoices and receipts totaling $250,000, were meticulously documented and stored in the accounting archives located in Room 204 of the main building. These archives are managed by Jane Smith, who oversees a team of 10 accountants responsible for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the financial data. The institution's internal audit team, comprising 7 members, conducted a review of these records on July 5th to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
