It seems like you're referring to a set of terms or elements that might be relevant to a voucher system, inventory management, or accounting procedures. Let's break down each term:

1. **Check**: This could refer to a written, printed, or digital document used to verify the accuracy of something or to aprove a transaction. In financial terms, a check is a written, dated, and signed instrument that instructs a bank to pay a specific sum of money to the bearer.

2. **Important Blank Voucher**: A blank voucher is a form that is yet to be filled out with details of a transaction. When labeled as "important," it suggests that this blank voucher is critical for a particular process or transaction. Once completed, it can serve as a proof of expenditure or as an authorization for payment.

3. **Management Information**: This refers to the data and information that is used by managers to make informed decisions within an organization. Management information systems (MIS) are designed to gather, process, and report on data that is relevant for managing an organization effectively.

4. **Quantity**: This term refers to the amount or number of items that are being considered or counted. In inventory management, for instance, keeping track of the quantity of items is essential for stock control and order fulfillment.

5. **Starting and Ending Number Range**: This generally refers to a sequence of numbers that establish a range. In the context of vouchers, this could mean the range of voucher numbers that are valid or have been issued within a certain period. For example, if voucher numbers start at 1000 and end at 1500, then all vouchers within this range are being accounted for or audited.

In a practical scenario, if you're dealing with an "important blank voucher" for management information purposes, you would need to:

- Fill in the quantity of goods or services purchased or sold.
- Assign it a unique number within the starting and ending number range (if applicable).
- Ensure that all relevant details are correctly entered for accurate reporting and auditing purposes.

The voucher, once completed, would become a critical document for tracking financial transactions, managing inventory, and providing information to the management team for decision-making.
