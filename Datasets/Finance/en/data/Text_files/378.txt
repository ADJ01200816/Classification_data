It seems like you're referencing various components of the recruitment process within financial institutions. Let's break down these terms and how they might relate to each other in a recruitment context:

1. **Financial Institutions**: These are companies that provide financial services such as banks, credit unions, insurance companies, investment firms, and more. They often have structured recruitment processes to fill various roles within their organizations.

2. **Recruitment Positions**: These are the specific jobs or roles that a financial institution is looking to fill. Recruitment positions could range from entry-level positions, like tellers or customer service representatives, to high-level positions like financial analysts, risk managers, or chief financial officers.

3. **Applicants**: Individuals who are interested in the recruitment positions and have submitted their qualifications for consideration are referred to as applicants. They may respond to job postings,招聘 ads, or networking opportunities.

4. **Application List**: This is a comprehensive collection of all the applicants for the recruitment positions. An application list typically includes the applicants’ details such as their resumes, cover letters, and any other relevant information they have provided.

5. **Number of Recruits**: This refers to the total number of individuals that the financial institution aims to hire for the recruitment positions. The number of recruits can be determined by various factors such as the institution's current staffing needs, budget constraints, and the number of qualified applicants available.

Below is a hypothetical scenario showing how these components interact:

- A financial institution needs to fill 5 new positions: 2 tellers, 1 financial analyst, and 2 customer service representatives.
- The recruitment positions are posted online and through various job boards, and a deadline is set for applications.
- By the deadline, the human resources department has compiled an application list of 150 applicants for these positions.
- After a thorough review and interview process, the financial institution selects the top candidates.
- The number of recruits for these positions is 5, with 1-2 backup candidates in case any of the primary selections do not accept the offer or do not meet pre-employment checks.

Understanding these terms and how they interrelate is crucial for effective recruitment and talent acquisition within any financial institution.
