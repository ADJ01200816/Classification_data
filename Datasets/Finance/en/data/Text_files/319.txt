In the field of accounting, several key concepts are integral to understanding how financial information is recorded and reported. Here's an explanation of the terms you've mentioned:

1. **Accounting Entity**: This refers to an organization or individual that engages in economic activities and for which accounting records are maintained. The accounting entity is considered separate from its owners and other entities. It could be a business, non-profit organization, government agency, or any other entity that needs to track its financial transactions.

2. **Transaction**: A transaction is a business event or activity that has a monetary impact on an accounting entity and can be measured in financial terms. It represents an exchange or interaction between the entity and another party, which often involves the transfer of assets, liabilities, revenue, or expenses. For example, the sale of goods, purchase of inventory, or payment of utilities are all considered transactions.

3. **Economic Activity**: Economic activity encompasses all the actions and behaviors of individuals, businesses, and organizations that are related to the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. In the context of accounting, it refers to those activities that affect the financial position of the accounting entity and therefore need to be recorded in the accounting system.

4. **Post Accounting Data**: This term refers to the process of recording transactions into the accounting system. Once a transaction occurs, the data needs to be posted to the appropriate accounts in the general ledger. This process involves entering the details of the transaction, such as the date, amount, accounts debited and credited, and other relevant information. The term "post accounting data" could also refer to the data after it has been recorded.

5. **Accounting Date**: The accounting date, also known as the accounting entry date or transaction date, is the specific date on which a transaction occurs and is recorded in the accounting system. It is the date on which the economic activity took place and affects the financial statements. The accounting date is important for purposes of financial reporting and tax compliance.

6. **Accounting Time**: This term refers to the period for which accounting records are prepared and financial statements are presented. It could be a fiscal year, a calendar year, a quarter, or any other period depending on the accounting standards and regulations applicable to the entity. "Accounting time" also encompasses the concept of the time period principle in accounting, which states that economic activities should be recorded in the accounting period in which they occur, regardless of when the cash is received or paid.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for accurate financial reporting and for making informed business decisions. Accountants and financial professionals must adhere to the principles and guidelines that govern these terms to ensure consistency and comparability of financial statements across different entities and periods.
