The name of a financial stability report can vary depending on the issuing institution or regulatory body. Common names include:

- "Financial Stability Report" – a straightforward and commonly used title.
- "Global Financial Stability Report" – issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
- "Financial Stability Review" – another generic title that might be used by various institutions.
- "Systemic Risk Report" or "Systemic Stability Report" – reports focusing on risks to the financial system as a whole.
- "Financial Stability Update" – a report that might be published more frequently to update stakeholders on the latest trends and risks.

Different countries' central banks or financial regulatory agencies might have their own specific names for such reports. For instance, the European Central Bank (ECB) issues the "ECB Financial Stability Review," while the Federal Reserve in the United States might release a "Financial Stability Report" as part of its broader suite of publications.
