In the digital records management system, the electronic files pertaining to individual case files are meticulously stored within a secure, encrypted database. Each entry is timestamped and associated with a unique alphanumeric identifier, ensuring traceability and integrity. The storage process involves the systematic recording of metadata, including file creation date, modification history, and access logs. The acceptance results for each document are logged in a separate, but linked, registry that details the outcome of verification procedures, such as approval status, reviewer comments, and any discrepancies noted. This registry is indexed by case number and cross-referenced with the primary document storage to facilitate quick retrieval and audit trails. Additionally, proof of storage documentation is generated automatically upon successful upload and verification. This documentation includes a digital certificate, bearing a cryptographic hash of the stored file, which serves as an immutable record of the file's existence and integrity at the time of storage. The certificate is then archived in a separate, tamper-evident repository, accessible only to authorized personnel, and is retrievable via a secure, role-based access control mechanism. Each step in this process is logged and monitored to ensure compliance with data retention policies and regulatory requirements.
