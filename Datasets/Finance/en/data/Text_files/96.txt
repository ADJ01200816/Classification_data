When dealing with a loan business, several key details are recorded for each loan transaction. Below is an explanation of each term you've listed, along with an example of how they might be filled out for a hypothetical loan:

1. **Loan Business**: This refers to the financial institution or lender that is providing the loan.

Example: 
- Loan Business: "Green Tree Financial Services"

Example:
- Loan Date: "2023-04-01"

3. **Loan Amount**: The total amount of money that is borrowed from the lender.

Example:

4. **Repayment Method**: The method by which the borrower will repay the loan. This could be through automatic bank transfers, checks, cash, or other payment methods.

Example:

5. **Repayment Amount**: The total amount that the borrower is required to pay back, which can include the principal amount borrowed plus any interest or fees.

Example:
