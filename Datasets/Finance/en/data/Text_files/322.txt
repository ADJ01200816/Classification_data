Each of these areas plays a vital role in the operations and strategic planning of financial institutions. Below is an overview of how these elements typically interrelate within the industry:

5. **Decision-Making Processes**: Institutions use various data and reports to make informed decisions about their operations, risk management, product offerings, and strategic direction.
