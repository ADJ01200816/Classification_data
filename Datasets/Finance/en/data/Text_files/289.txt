In the context of financial institutions, the execution of work orders is meticulously governed by a comprehensive framework encompassing laws, regulations, policies, and norms. These directives possess binding force, ensuring compliance across all operational facets. Specifically, the company's articles of association delineate the foundational principles and organizational structure. The company financial management system outlines protocols for budgeting, expenditure, and financial reporting, while the company asset management system details the acquisition, utilization, and disposal of assets. Additionally, the IT governance system and IT information technology management system provide structured guidelines for managing electronic document data, encompassing data security, access controls, and archival procedures. For instance, Article 12 of the company articles of association mandates annual financial audits, while Section 5.3 of the IT governance system specifies encryption standards for sensitive data. These interconnected systems collectively ensure adherence to regulatory requirements and internal standards, facilitating seamless and compliant operational workflows.
