In the loan business, when a borrower fails to meet the terms of their loan agreement, it results in a default. This is a critical aspect of the lending industry, and several pieces of data are relevant when dealing with defaults. Here's a breakdown of the key information related to loan defaults:

1. **Relevant Data Information**: This includes details about the borrower and the loan that can influence the likelihood of default and the lender's actions afterward:

   - Borrower Information: Name, contact details, credit score, financial history, and income level.
   - Loan Details: Loan amount, interest rate, repayment schedule, purpose of the loan, collateral involved (if any), and loan-to-value ratio.
   - Economic Factors: Current economic conditions, industry performance (especially if the loan is for business purposes), and unemployment rates.

2. **Default Type**: Defaults can vary in nature based on the terms violated:

   - Payment Default: The borrower fails to make the required payments by the due dates.
   - Covenant Default: The borrower violates other terms of the loan agreement, such as financial covenants (e.g., debt-to-equity ratios) or reporting requirements.
   - Technical Default: A default that occurs when the borrower violates a minor condition of the loan agreement, which may not necessarily involve a payment or financial covenant.

3. **Default Date**: This is the date on which the default officially occurred, typically defined as the date when a payment or obligation was due and not met or the date when a covenant violation was identified.

4. **Default Penalty Payment Ratio**: This ratio could refer to several things, but generally, it would be a measure of the penalty imposed on the borrower in the event of a default, compared to the amount of the loan that is in default. It may be expressed in the following ways:

   - A fixed percentage of the loan amount that is due and unpaid.
   - A percentage of the total outstanding loan balance at the time of default.
   - A flat fee that is charged as a penalty for the default.

For example, if a borrower has a loan of $100,000 and defaults on the payment, and the penalty is 5% of the outstanding balance, the default penalty payment ratio would be 5% in this scenario, resulting in a penalty of $5,000.

It is important for lenders to clearly outline the default penalties in the loan agreements, as these penalties are enforceable by law and are designed to compensate the lender for the increased risk and costs associated with managing a delinquent loan account. The penalty should be within the legal limits set by the jurisdiction in which the loan agreement was made.
