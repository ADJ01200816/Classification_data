Commercial banks engage in various financial activities, and one of their services includes providing guarantees to assure the repayment ability of their customers. This is done through different financial instruments that mitigate the risk of default. Here's an overview of the terms and services mentioned in your question:

1. **Customer Debt Repayment Ability**: This refers to the capacity of a customer to repay the loans or debts they owe to the bank or other financial institutions.

2. **Assume Customer Default Risk**: When a bank provides a guarantee, it essentially assumes the risk that the customer may default on their debt obligations. This means that if the customer fails to pay, the bank is obligated to cover the debt.

Below are the financial instruments and arrangements through which banks manage and provide guarantees:

3. **Acceptance Bills**: These are a type of short-term credit instrument, typically used in international trade, where a bank accepts responsibility to pay a specified sum of money at a future date. By accepting a bill of exchange, the bank guarantees its payment, which can be used by the holder to secure financing or as a guarantee for other transactions.

4. **Standby Letters of Credit (SBLC)**: This is a guarantee of payment issued by a bank on behalf of a customer, which is used as a "backup" payment method. In the event that the customer fails to make payment to the beneficiary (typically a supplier or service provider), the bank will step in and make the payment instead.

5. **Letters of Guarantee**: These are written commitments by a bank to pay a certain sum of money if the client fails to fulfill their contractual obligations. This can be used in various contexts such as fulfilling contractual obligations, customs transactions, or as a performance guarantee.

6. **Financial Asset Management Companies**: These are entities that specialize in managing financial assets on behalf of clients, which can include investing in a diversified portfolio of financial instruments to maximize returns. Sometimes, banks may provide guarantees related to the performance or creditworthiness of such companies or their transactions.

7. **Member Units**: This term is somewhat general and could refer to different entities depending on the context. In the context of a bank's services, it might refer to corporate customers or institutional clients that are part of a larger group or association. Banks might provide guarantees to these member units as part of their business relationships.

8. **Maintain Agreements**: This likely refers to the maintenance of various service or lending agreements that banks have with their customers. Within such agreements, there might be provisions for the bank to provide guarantees to secure the obligations of the customer under certain terms and conditions.

Overall, these services are a critical part of the banking business, allowing customers to engage in larger transactions with reduced risk to the other party involved, and facilitating commerce and trade by providing a layer of trust through the bank's guarantee.
