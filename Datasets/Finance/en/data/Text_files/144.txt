To provide you with the specific information you've requested, I would need to know the name of the enterprise or additional details about it. However, I can explain what each of these terms means in the context of a business registration:

1. **Legal Representative:** The legal representative is the person designated by the enterprise to act on its behalf in legal matters. This person's name is typically listed on official documents.

2. **Enterprise Name:** This is the official name of the business as registered with the appropriate government authorities.

Below are the definitions for the rest:

3. **Unified Social Credit Code (USCC):** A unique identifier assigned to each enterprise in China. It combines the business registration number, organization code, and tax registration number into one code.

4. **Business License:** A document issued by the government that authorizes an enterprise to conduct business legally within a specific jurisdiction.

5. **Business Scope:** This defines the range of activities that the enterprise is legally allowed to undertake, as outlined in its business license.

6. **Industry Classification:** This refers to the category or categories that the enterprise's primary business activities fall under, according to a standardized classification system.

7. **Economic Type:** This describes the ownership structure of the enterprise, such as state-owned, private, joint venture, foreign-owned, etc.

8. **Personnel Scale:** The number of employees the enterprise has, which can range from a small business with a few employees to a large corporation with thousands.

9. **Registered Capital:** The amount of capital that the enterprise has registered with the government, which represents the initial investment in the business and the maximum liability of the shareholders.

10. **Enterprise Address:** The official address of the enterprise where it conducts its business operations and is available for legal correspondence.

If you provide the name of the enterprise, I can assist you in finding this information, but as an AI, I don't have direct access to databases for this purpose.
