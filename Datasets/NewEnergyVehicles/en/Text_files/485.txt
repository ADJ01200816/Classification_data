The data collected includes a unique identifier (vin code), indicating the specific vehicle associated with the information. The alarm type symbol identifies the nature of the alert, such as a theft or mechanical issue. The alarm level ranges from low to critical, reflecting the severity of the situation. The alarm start and end time provides a temporal context for the event. The alarm type further specifies the type of alarm, whether it's a low fuel level or a brake failure. The geographical coordinates, start and end latitude and longitude, pinpoint the location where the alarm occurred.
