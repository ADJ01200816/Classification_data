The data record indicates that a specific event has occurred, characterized by a unique vin code associated with a particular vehicle. This event has triggered an alarm, identified by an alarm type symbol, which has been assigned an alarm level that indicates its severity. The alarm was initiated at a specific start time and terminated at an end time, both of which are recorded in the system. The event took place within a defined geographic area, with coordinates for both the start and end latitude and longitude provided. These details are crucial for the analysis and response to the alarm, ensuring that appropriate actions are taken to address the situation.
