The data records indicate that the individual in question possesses a unique identifier, referred to as a "vin code," which is associated with a specific vehicle. During a certain period, an "alarm type symbol" was activated, signaling an "alarm level" of concern. The event began at a particular "alarm start time" and concluded at a designated "alarm end time." The geographical coordinates for the occurrence of the alarm were noted as "start and end latitude and longitude" values.
