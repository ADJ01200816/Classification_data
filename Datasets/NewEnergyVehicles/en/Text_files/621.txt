The individual in question has been identified by a unique identifier, which is represented by a series of digits and letters. The alarm system has detected a specific type of alert, indicated by a particular symbol. The severity of the alarm is classified as follows: low, medium, or high, with 'alarm level' being the corresponding term used to denote this. The alarm was triggered at a specific time, which is recorded in a 24-hour format, and terminated at another precise moment. The alarm's event type is categorized under 'alarm type,' and this information is crucial for further analysis. The geographical coordinates at which the alarm was initiated and terminated are provided in terms of latitude and longitude, with 'start and end latitude and longitude' being the descriptive terms for these coordinates.
