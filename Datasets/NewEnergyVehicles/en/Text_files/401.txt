The system detected a series of events associated with an individual. The individual was identified by a unique vin code, which was linked to various data points. An alarm type symbol was generated to signify the occurrence of a particular event. This symbol was classified under a specific alarm level, indicating the severity of the event. The alarm began at a particular start time and ended at an end time, both of which were recorded with precision.

During the event, the alarm type was identified as a specific category, which provided insight into the nature of the situation. The coordinates of the start and end points of the event were noted with latitude and longitude values, allowing for precise location tracking. Additional data points included other relevant information such as alarm duration, event description, and any associated actions taken.
