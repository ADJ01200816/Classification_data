In the digital age, personal data is collected and stored in various formats. For instance, a set of unique identifiers includes genetic information such as genes, which can be identified through genetic tests. Additionally, physical biometric data like fingerprints, voiceprints, palm prints, and earlobes can be captured through specialized devices. These biometric characteristics are highly individualistic and serve as unique identifiers for individuals. Furthermore, the human eye is another source of biometric data, with irises being particularly distinctive, as they are scanned and recorded for security purposes. In terms of personal appearance, facial features are also used for identification, with advancements in facial recognition technology making it a common method for access control. In a broader context, demographic information such as gender, nationality, and employment details are often stored. For instance, a male employee identified as a Chinese citizen earns a monthly salary of 50,000 yuan, which corresponds to an annual tax payment of 8,000 yuan. These pieces of information are compiled into comprehensive profiles, which are crucial for maintaining secure systems and records.
