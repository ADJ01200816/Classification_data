Patient A, a male of 35 years of age, is a resident of France. He has a monthly income of €40,000, with a corresponding tax liability of €7,200. In the past year, he has visited an outpatient department (emergency) twice, with the medical records documenting diagnoses of acute appendicitis and gastritis. A subsequent hospitalization order was issued for an elective appendectomy, with the procedure performed under general anesthesia. The preoperative examination and testing reports revealed a hemoglobin level of 14.2 g/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 19 mg/dL. Postoperatively, the patient received intravenous antibiotics and analgesics, as well as blood transfusions to maintain hemoglobin levels. During his hospital stay, the patient was under the care of a team of registered nurses, who documented his daily vital signs and response to treatment. The discharge summary indicated a full recovery and the patient was discharged after seven days. Referral records show that the patient was referred to a specialist for follow-up care, with an informed consent form on file.
