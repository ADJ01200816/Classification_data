John Doe, a 35-year-old male residing in the United States, recently visited the City General Hospital for an outpatient emergency consultation. His medical records indicate a diagnosis of acute appendicitis, as detailed in the examination report dated March 15, 2023. The attending physician, Dr. Emily Smith, ordered a series of tests, including a complete blood count and abdominal ultrasound, the results of which were documented in the testing reports filed on the same day. 

Upon confirmation of the diagnosis, John was admitted for surgical intervention. The hospitalization order, signed by Dr. Smith, specified a scheduled appendectomy for March 16, 2023.

Nursing records, updated daily, documented his recovery progress, including vital signs, pain management, and wound care. Additionally, a blood transfusion record from March 17, 2023, indicates he received one unit of O-negative blood due to post-operative anemia.
