Test data obtained includes a complete blood count (CBC) with elevated eosinophils, lung function tests showing mild asthma, and a positive allergy skin test. Genetic counseling data suggests a possible mutation in the interleukin-4 receptor gene. Health-related data collected from wearable devices indicate an irregular sleep pattern and a sedentary lifestyle. Gene sequencing revealed a variant in the interleukin-10 receptor gene, while transcript sequencing identified upregulated interleukin-6 expression. Protein analysis and determination indicated increased levels of interleukin-6 in the blood. Metabolic small molecule monitoring showed elevated levels of histamine and other inflammatory markers. Human microbiome monitoring revealed an imbalance in the gut microbiota, with reduced levels of beneficial bacteria.
