In a groundbreaking study, researchers analyzed various unique biological markers from participants. They closely examined the small segments that carry instructions for our traits, often found in specific patterns. Additionally, they used the unique patterns left on surfaces to identify individuals. For further identification, they utilized the sound wave patterns, the distinctive patterns on the palms, the shape of the small projecting part of the ear, the colored ring around the pupil, and the distinct shapes and contours of one's face.以下是样本字符串：


"Researchers studied the markers, including the ones that dictate traits, the ones left on glass, the ones captured in audio, the ones on hands, the projection on ears, the rings in eyes, and the unique face contours."
