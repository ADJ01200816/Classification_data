In the realm of biometric data, genes are uniquely represented by a series of A, T, C, and G sequences, while fingerprints are characterized by the intricate patterns found on the fingertips. Voiceprints are distinguished by the frequency, pitch, and intensity of the sound waves produced by the vocal cords. Palm prints identify individuals through the distinctive ridges and whorls present on the palm of the hand. Earlobes are recognized by their shape and attachment to the face, and irises are identified by the complex patterns of colored tissue within the eye. Facial features such as the shape of the nose, the distance between the eyes, and the contours of the face are also used to create unique identifiers. In terms of personal information, an individual's name is represented by a string of characters, gender is denoted by binary data (M or F), nationality is indicated by a country code, income is recorded as a monetary value, and tax amount is represented as a numerical figure. Additionally, contact information is stored as a sequence of digits, typically formatted as a phone number.
