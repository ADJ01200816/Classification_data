The patient's lifestyle includes a diet high in saturated fats and moderate alcohol consumption. Recent gene sequencing revealed a mutation in the LPL gene, which is associated with a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis.

Protein analysis and determination indicated elevated levels of interleukin-6, indicating inflammation. Metabolic small molecule monitoring revealed a high level of homocysteine, which is associated with cardiovascular risk. Human microbiome monitoring showed an imbalance in gut flora, with a higher abundance of pathogenic bacteria.
