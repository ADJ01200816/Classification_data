During my recent visit, I mentioned my main issue was a persistent cough. I've been experiencing this for the past two weeks. Previously, I had undergone surgery for a knee injury in 2019. During the check-up, the doctor noticed I had a fever and a rash. My mom has a history of diabetes. I've also been feeling fatigued and short of breath. My blood test results from last month showed elevated levels. For genetic insights, I underwent a special test last year. In terms of daily life, I wear a fitness tracker that monitors my steps and sleep. Additionally, some advanced tests included sequencing, protein levels, and checking my microorganisms.
