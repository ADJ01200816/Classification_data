In the latest biological study, researchers analyzed various unique identifiers from participants. They started by examining the microscopic blueprints found within the cells, then moved on to the distinctive patterns left on surfaces. For audio analysis, they recorded the unique sound waves produced by each individual. Physical characteristics such as the patterns on their hands, the shape of their ear extensions, the colorful circles in their eyes, and the unique contours of their faces were also studied extensively.
