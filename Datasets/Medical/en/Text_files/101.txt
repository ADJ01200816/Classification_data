In the biometric database, an individual identified as John Doe exhibits a unique genetic profile characterized by a specific sequence of nucleotides: AGCTTACGGA. His fingerprints, recorded in the AFIS system, display a distinct pattern of loops and whorls, particularly on the right index finger with a minutiae point count of 35. Voiceprint analysis reveals a frequency range of 85-180 Hz, with a notable peak at 120 Hz during phonation of the vowel 'e'. Palm print records indicate a unique ridge pattern, especially on the hypothenar region, with an average ridge count of 150. Earlobe morphology shows a free-hanging structure with a length of 2.5 cm and a width of 1.8 cm. Iris scans reveal a complex pattern of crypts and furrows, with a distinct pigment distribution and a diameter of 11.5 mm in the right eye. Facial features are documented with precise measurements: a nose length of 4.2 cm, an interpupillary distance of 6.3 cm, and a jawline angle of 125 degrees. These biometric data points collectively form a comprehensive profile for identity verification purposes.
