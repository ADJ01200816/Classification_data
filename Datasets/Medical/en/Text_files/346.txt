In the biometric database, an individual identified as John Doe exhibits a unique genetic sequence, specifically ATCGGCTAAGGTTCC, which is distinct to his DNA profile. His fingerprints, recorded in the AFIS system, show a pattern of loops and whorls, with the right thumb displaying a distinct delta formation. Voiceprint analysis reveals a frequency range of 85 to 180 Hz, characterized by a mild vibrato, particularly noticeable during sustained vowels. Palm print scans indicate a unique ridge pattern, with the left palm featuring an unusual trifurcation at the center. Earlobe morphology shows a free-hanging structure on both ears, with the right earlobe displaying a small appendage. Iris scans of both eyes reveal intricate patterns, with the left iris exhibiting a prominent spoke-like feature at the 3 o'clock position. Facial recognition data points to specific landmarks, including a nose width of 4.2 cm, an interpupillary distance of 6.5 cm, and a jawline angle of 120 degrees, forming a comprehensive map of his facial structure.
