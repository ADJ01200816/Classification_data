In the process of identifying personal data, several biometric features have been utilized. For instance, a person's genetic makeup is represented by unique genes, which are used for identification purposes. Additionally, fingerprints provide a distinctive pattern that can be matched against a database for verification. Voiceprints, another form of biometric data, analyze the tone, pitch, and rhythm of a person's speech to distinguish between individuals. Palm prints, characterized by the unique patterns found on the palm of the hand, are also used for identification. The shape and size of a person's earlobes can be recorded and compared to verify identity. Iris recognition, which involves the detailed patterns found in the colored part of the eye, is a highly accurate method for personal identification. Lastly, facial features such as the shape of the face, eyes, nose, and mouth are analyzed and compared to establish a person's identity.
