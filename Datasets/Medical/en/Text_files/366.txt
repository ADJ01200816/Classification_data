In the database, there are several unique identifiers associated with an individual's personal information. These identifiers include a set of genetic markers represented by the symbols 'genes', biometric data such as 'fingerprints', 'voiceprints', and 'palm prints', physical attributes like 'earlobes', and distinctive features of the eye known as 'irises'. Additionally, the individual's 'facial features' have been captured and recorded. The person in question is identified by a specific 'phone number', which is a critical piece of contact information. Their monthly earnings are documented as '50,000', while the corresponding 'tax amount' is recorded as '8,000'. These figures are indicative of their 'income situation' and are relevant for financial and tax-related records.
