In a groundbreaking biometric research, scientists have been studying various unique identifiers. They found that the combination of individual A's unique patterns, which are found in their DNA, and B's marks that are left when touching surfaces can be highly识别. Similarly, C's audio waves and D's hand patterns are also crucial. In addition, the shape of E's ear part, the colors of F's eye, and the distinct traits of G's face are all part of the study.
