In the comprehensive biometric dataset compiled for a multi-factor authentication system, an individual identified by the unique identifier XJL-7892 exhibits distinct physiological characteristics. The genetic profile associated with XJL-7892 reveals a specific sequence of nucleotides, including an adenine-thymine-guanine-cytosine pattern at chromosome 6, position 15234567. The fingerprint records for this individual consist of a loop pattern on the right index finger, with a minutiae point density of 25 points per square centimeter. Voiceprint analysis indicates a fundamental frequency of 110 Hz, with formant frequencies at 500 Hz, 1500 Hz, and 2500 Hz during sustained vowel production. Palm print data for XJL-7892 show a unique ridge pattern on the left palm, characterized by an intersection point at coordinates (45, 67) relative to a standardized palm grid. Earlobe morphology is noted as free-hanging, with a length of 2.3 cm and a width of 1.1 cm at the base. Iris scans reveal a complex texture with a diameter of 11.5 mm, featuring a spoke-like pattern radiating from the pupil. Facial features are documented with precise measurements: an interpupillary distance of 6.2 cm, a nose width of 3.8 cm, and a jawline length of 15.4 cm, captured using high-resolution 3D imaging techniques. These detailed biometric markers collectively ensure a high level of accuracy in identity verification processes.
