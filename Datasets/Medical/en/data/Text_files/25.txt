My name is Jane Doe, and I recently received my ID card with the number 123456789. I also obtained a work permit and a residence permit, both valid for the next five years. My social security card has a unique number, and I have a health card number for medical purposes. During my last hospitalization, I was assigned a hospitalization number. Additionally, for various inspections and tests, I have several tracking numbers for documentation.
