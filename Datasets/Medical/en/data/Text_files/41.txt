In a groundbreaking study, researchers analyzed various biological markers from participants. They closely examined the unique patterns found in their DNA, as well as the distinct lines and ridges present on their hands and fingers. Additionally, they recorded the unique sound waves produced by their voices. The study also included detailed scans of the participants' ears, the colorful circles in their eyes, and the distinct shapes and contours of their faces.
