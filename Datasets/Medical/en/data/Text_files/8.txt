During the visit, the patient was required to provide the pink slip from the urgent care visit, which led to the blue document for inpatient stay. The green papers detailed the various scans and tests conducted, while the yellow sheet outlined the pills taken. The purple folder contained the timeline of treatment, including the specific procedure done under the special gas. The red file noted the life-giving fluid exchange, and the white pages documented the care provided. The initial welcome packet was reviewed, as well as the final report before transitioning. The transfer document for another facility was also signed, along with the consent for all procedures.
