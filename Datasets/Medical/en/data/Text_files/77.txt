During my recent visit, I mentioned my primary issue which has been bothering me. Over the past few weeks, I experienced some new issues, including a fever and a cough. In the past, I had a surgery for my knee injury. My doctor conducted a physical check, noting my elevated pulse and rash. My family has a history of diabetes. Additionally, I’ve been feeling fatigued and had some abnormal blood results. Recently, I underwent genetic consultation. My daily habits include regular exercise and a healthy diet. I also had my genes, RNA, and proteins analyzed, along with monitoring my metabolism and microbiome. Here’s the data from my smart watch too.
