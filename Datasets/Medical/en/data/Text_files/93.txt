Yesterday, Mr. Zhang visited the clinic with a sudden pain, and the following documents were created: his immediate visit document, a subsequent order for inpatient stay, and various reports after his thorough checks. During his stay, he was given specific drugs, and detailed logs of his treatment, a procedure under anesthesia, and a safe blood event were recorded. The staff also maintained detailed care logs. Upon entry and exit, specific documents were prepared, including a final discharge summary. He was also referred to another facility, with all necessary consent documented.
