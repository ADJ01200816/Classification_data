In a groundbreaking study, researchers analyzed various biological markers from participants. They closely examined the unique patterns found in their DNA, as well as the distinctive lines and ridges on their fingertips. Additionally, they recorded the unique sound waves of their voices and captured the intricate patterns of their palm and earlobes. To enhance identification, they also used advanced technology to scan the intricate colors and patterns in their irises and facial details.
