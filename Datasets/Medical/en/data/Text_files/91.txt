In a groundbreaking study, researchers analyzed various biological markers from participants. They collected samples of the unique patterns found in their DNA, which are often referred to by an acronym that starts with "G". Additionally, they used the distinctive patterns from hands, which are commonly used in identification. The study also included voice recordings, capturing the unique traits from each person's larynx. For further identification, they examined the following: the shape and lines of the hands' bottom part, the unique shape of the body part near the ear, the colorful part of the eye, and the distinct characteristics of one's face.
