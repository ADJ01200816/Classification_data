At 3 AM, the patient was brought to the department where the incident report was filled out immediately. The patient underwent multiple procedures, starting with a quick diagnostic process and then issued a special order. The following day, a detailed document was prepared, outlining all the substances administered. During the stay, a series of sessions were recorded, including one intense procedure under special conditions. Additionally, a critical intervention with a specific product was logged. Here is the sample string:
