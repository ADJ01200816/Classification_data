In a groundbreaking study, researchers analyzed various unique biological markers from participants. They started by examining the tiny blueprints within our cells, then moved on to the unique patterns found on our fingers. Additionally, they recorded the distinct sound waves produced by each individual's voice. The study also included capturing the intricate lines and patterns on the palms, the shape and size of the lower part of our ears, the colorful circles that surround the pupil, and the combination of shapes that make up our faces.
