John has been experiencing shortness of breath lately, especially when climbing stairs. He mentioned that he had a similar episode two years ago, which was diagnosed as asthma. During the recent visit, his blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, and he mentioned his father had hypertension. John also reported using his wearable device, which showed increased heart rate during sleep. He is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. The lab results included a genetic test, showing a mutation in the XYZ gene, and transcript levels of ABC were elevated. Protein levels of PQR were analyzed, and metabolic markers like glucose were within normal range. His microbiome analysis indicated an imbalance in gut flora.
