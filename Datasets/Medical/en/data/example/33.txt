Yesterday, Mr. Smith visited the clinic with a sudden onset of pain, and the following documents were generated: a urgent visit document, followed by a paper directing him to an inpatient stay. During his stay, he underwent various documents, including a detailed scan report, multiple drug admin details, and a timeline of his treatment. He also had a procedure where a detailed surgery log, anesthetic report, and a session of red blood cell transfer were recorded. Nurses updated their logs, and he had entry and exit documents, including a comprehensive discharge note. Finally, he was referred with a document to another facility, all under his consent.
