Yesterday, Mr. Zhang visited the clinic with a sudden onset of pain. He was quickly triaged and the following documents were generated: a document detailing his urgent visit, a paper allowing him to be admitted for further care, several papers detailing his scans and tests, a list of meds he was prescribed, his treatment timeline, a detailed account of his procedure, notes on his anesthetic experience, records of his blood product administration, daily care logs, his entry paperwork, a summary of his stay and discharge, a document referring him to another facility, and a signed consent form.
