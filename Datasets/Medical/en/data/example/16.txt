In a groundbreaking study, researchers analyzed the unique markers found in biological samples. They focused on specific segments within our DNA, known for their distinct patterns. Additionally, they examined the intricate loops and whorls found on the tips of our fingers, as well as the minute ridges and valleys that make up the contours of our palms. The study also included the analysis of the distinctive patterns visible in the center of our eyes, the shape and size of the outer edges of our ears, and the unique characteristics that define our faces. To enhance security measures, voice recordings were scrutinized for their waveforms and frequencies.
