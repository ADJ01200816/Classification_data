You seem to be referring to the concepts of domestic and overseas transactions, as well as the purchase and sale of Renminbi (RMB) and foreign exchange, which are key aspects of a country's financial system, particularly relevant for China.

Let's break down the terms and their implications:

1. **Domestic Transactions**: These are financial transactions that occur within the borders of a country. In the case of China, domestic transactions would refer to those conducted in RMB, which is the official currency of the People's Republic of China.

   - **RMB Purchase and Sale Business Amount (Domestic)**: This would refer to the total value of RMB transactions that take place domestically, including the buying and selling of goods and services, investments, and other financial activities within China.

2. **Overseas Transactions**: These are transactions that occur across international borders, involving foreign currencies.

   - **Foreign Exchange Purchase and Sale**: This refers to the conversion of one currency into another, typically conducted by financial institutions and banks. In the context of China, it would involve the buying and selling of foreign currencies for RMB or vice versa.

3. **Related Business**: This term can encompass a variety of activities associated with the financial industry, such as foreign exchange trading, money laundering prevention, compliance with international regulations, and so on.

   - **RMB Purchase and Sale Business Amount (Overseas)**: This would be the total value of RMB transactions that occur internationally, including trade settlements, investment flows, and currency exchanges between RMB and foreign currencies.

The Chinese government and financial institutions closely monitor the following:

- The **balance of payments**, which records all economic transactions between residents of a country and the rest of the world.
- The **supply and demand for RMB and foreign exchange**, which affects the exchange rate and the stability of the currency.
- **Capital flows**: The movement of money in and out of the country, which can impact the economy.

The **business amount** in RMB purchase and sale, both domestically and overseas, is a key indicator for policymakers, as it reflects economic activity, trade balances, and the overall health of the financial system.

In China, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) is responsible for the regulation and management of foreign exchange, ensuring that the amount of RMB purchased and sold, both domestically and internationally, aligns with the country's economic policies and stability objectives.
