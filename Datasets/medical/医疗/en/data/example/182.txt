It seems like you're referring to a scenario involving cross-border settlements, particularly emphasizing the roles of settlements and banks in the process. Cross-border settlement typically involves the transfer of funds from one country to another, often in a different currency, to settle transactions like imports and exports, foreign investments, or other international financial transactions.

When discussing "settlement, settlement, bank as the main body, cross-border settlement receipt amount," it might be broken down as follows:

1. **Settlement**: This term generally refers to the process of finalizing a financial transaction. In the context of cross-border transactions, it involves the transfer of funds between the bank (or financial institution) of the buyer and the bank of the seller.

2. **Bank as the Main Body**: This suggests that the bank plays a central role in the cross-border settlement process. Banks facilitate the movement of funds, handle currency conversions if necessary, and ensure that the transaction complies with all legal and regulatory requirements.

3. **Cross-border Settlement Receipt Amount**: This is the amount of money received in a cross-border transaction. It is the amount that the seller or the beneficiary receives after the settlement process is complete. This amount may be influenced by various factors, such as exchange rates, fees, and charges associated with the transaction.

In practical terms, here’s how these elements might come together:

- **Initiation**: A cross-border trade transaction is initiated between a buyer and a seller in different countries.

- **Agreement**: The terms of the trade, including the amount to be paid and the currency, are agreed upon.

- **Settlement Process**: The buyer’s bank (the instructing bank) sends a payment instruction to the seller’s bank (the receiving bank) to settle the amount due.

- **Exchange Rate**: If the currencies differ, the banks will handle the conversion at the current exchange rate, which may affect the final receipt amount.

- **Fees and Charges**: Banks may deduct fees and charges for their services, which can also affect the final amount received.

- **Settlement Completion**: Once all the necessary checks and conversions are made, the receiving bank credits the agreed amount (less any fees or charges) to the seller's account.

- **Cross-border Settlement Receipt**: The seller receives confirmation of the amount settled, which serves as a receipt for the cross-border transaction.
