Deposit insurance is a crucial component of the financial system that aims to protect depositors' funds in the event of a bank or financial institution failing. The specifics of deposit insurance schemes can vary from country to country, but the general principles are similar. Here is some general information about the concepts you've mentioned:

1. **Deposit Insurance Business:**
   - This refers to the operations related to providing deposit insurance coverage. Deposit insurance agencies or corporations usually manage this business. They collect premiums from insured financial institutions and use these funds to protect depositors when a member institution fails.

2. **Insured Financial Institutions:**
   - These are banks or other financial entities that are covered by a deposit insurance scheme. depositors' accounts in these institutions are insured up to a certain amount, which is determined by the deposit insurance scheme's rules.

3. **Institutional Rating:**
   - An institutional rating is a measure of a financial institution's creditworthiness, financial health, and overall risk profile. Rating agencies assign these ratings to help investors and other stakeholders assess the institution's stability and performance.
   - Ratings can consider various factors, such as capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk.

4. **Information:**
   - The information used to determine the institutional rating typically includes financial statements, regulatory reports, and other data that provide insight into the institution's operations. This information is carefully analyzed to assess the institution's ability to meet its obligations, including repaying depositors in the event of a failure.

5. **Total Score of Institutional Rating:**
   - The total score in an institutional rating is derived from the aggregation of the scores in various categories (like the ones mentioned above). This score is used to assign a rating to the institution.
   - The methodology for calculating the score can vary between rating agencies, but it generally involves a weighted scoring system that reflects the relative importance of different factors.

6. **Corresponding Level:**
   - The corresponding level is the category or tier that an institution falls into based on its total score in the institutional rating. These levels can be something like "AAA" (highest), "AA", "A", "BBB", and so on, down to lower ratings that indicate higher risk.
   - The levels may also be translated into qualitative descriptions, such as "sound", "satisfactory", "marginal", or "unsatisfactory", to provide a clearer picture of the institution's health.

The ratings and corresponding levels are important not only for the deposit insurance agency to assess the risk profiles of the institutions they insure but also for depositors, investors, and regulators to make informed decisions. A higher rating generally indicates lower risk, while a lower rating may signal greater risk and closer supervision by regulators.
